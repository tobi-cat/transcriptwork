Hey, everyone.

00:00:04:08 - 00:00:54:39
James
I just want to preface this. This is not an April Fools Day video. Bad timing, but it's not an April Fools Day video. We just got our lowest Patreon payout in well over a year and by a lot like less than half of of what we usually get a month. This kind of coinciding with the YouTube videos doing not great in general a year ago most videos were doing about 300,000 views.

00:00:56:00 - 00:01:30:14
James
Now we're very lucky if we can get to 200,000. Usually they're not even crossing there. YouTube has started hitting some of our videos with 18 plus ratings, which basically kill the video dead. There's it's just it's just dead and there's you know, always the the pain in the butt of people not getting notified when videos come out and stuff like that, which is we've kind of gotten used to that.

00:01:30:14 - 00:02:09:45
James
But there was always the Patreon as this sort of not back up, but there's this bedrock arc that we had where we knew that even if YouTube was, you know, being a dick, uh, our patrons were still there and it now it looks like maybe not this month we got less than half of our worst month in the past year.

00:02:11:45 - 00:02:44:11
James
It was or no mid 2021 since we've seen numbers this low. And because YouTube is, you know, not sending the videos out and our views are way down, we're not getting a whole lot of ad revenue. And now with this huge drop in in patron numbers or patron income, the patron numbers seem to be the same as usual, but the income is way down.

00:02:44:40 - 00:03:26:13
James
So I'm assuming a lot of patrons have had to reduce their pledges for, you know, financial reasons. That's completely understandable. But, uh, with with the amount that came in this month, I don't know if we'll be able to continue with the channel. Um, there's just not enough there to pay bills. And for, for Nick and I especially living, you know, we live, we don't live together now.

00:03:26:13 - 00:03:59:02
James
We live apart, and so we're not roommates anymore. And so it and Nick is, you know, if you don't know, Nick is a writer and co-producer on on the videos and if if the patron numbers stay like that then it's we can't really I don't I don't think we can keep going which really sucks. We had a bunch of plans.

00:04:01:24 - 00:04:26:29
James
Well, we had a bunch of plans specifically for patrons. There's a video coming out, uh, supposed to come out later. It was supposed to come out next weekend. Um, and there's going to be a, a whole other version of it just for patrons doing more things like watch alongs where we get to interact with the patrons and watch movies and stuff like that.

00:04:26:29 - 00:05:17:02
James
We've been trying to do more stuff like that, kind of make it worth being a patron. But like video wise, we have a bunch of stuff planned. But I don't know if if that's going to be possible. Um, I've really, really enjoyed this last year where we, we really had a really solid bedrock with patrons. Um, I'm not sure if we've done something what it might be, but, uh, with YouTube being the way it is, and if patrons, if the patron stays this low, I don't think, I don't think the channel will be long for this world.

00:05:17:56 - 00:05:51:12
James
Um, as sounds so dramatic, but yeah, we're. We won't be able to focus on videos. We won't be able to do videos anymore. I've loved doing this so much. This is when things got really if you follow me on Twitter and stuff like that, you know, things got really, really dark for me in December. And it was being, you know, being able to make videos that that kind of drew me back out of that.

00:05:52:03 - 00:06:24:30
James
And so I'm really going to miss that. So I hope. Sorry. I hope that maybe something works out. But if things stay the way they are, um, so I just wanted to put this out there. Uh, just so that, you know, in case the channel goes quiet so that you, you know, why hopefully something works out and we can keep doing this.

00:06:26:04 - 00:07:00:03
James
Cause I love making these videos. I love making especially the educational videos, the historical videos. I love making the video essays where, you know, we get to talk about smart stuff and I can go all crazy with cinematography and sets and lighting and stuff like that. And it just it's like I know it's it's so corny and stupid, but I love my job and it it really suck.

00:07:01:22 - 00:07:48:21
James
It would really suck if, uh, if I couldn't do this anymore. But I hope hopefully something works out. But yeah, I just it was like a, like, kick in the teeth, seeing, seeing those numbers because that's, that's not even being able to, being able for Nick and I to pay the rent. Um, I mean we're in a bad spot, but for everyone who is a patron or, and has been a patron, I want to thank you and everyone who watches the channel, the videos on the channel and share them and everything.

00:07:48:21 - 00:08:12:12
James
I want to thank you too. You've been amazing. And hopefully, hopefully something works out and we can keep going. But if not, I just want you to know that I really appreciated you giving me the ability to do this for as long as I have. Um. Yeah.

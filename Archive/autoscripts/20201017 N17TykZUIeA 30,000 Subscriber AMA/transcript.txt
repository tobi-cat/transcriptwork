00:00:24:29 - 00:00:27:27
James
I get here and everyone's talking about vampire cults.

00:00:29:27 - 00:01:08:02
James
What is going on? Angel, come on. Phone, everyone.

00:01:14:20 - 00:01:49:17
James
So this is my first time streaming in any kind of way in forever. So it's been quite an interesting experience today, trying to get this set up. I have like six or seven microphones with, like, good filters on them. None of them can be plugged into a USB port. They're all like, I can't remember the cord as called now, but they're all like professional grade microphones.

00:01:49:17 - 00:01:58:27
James
So I had to run around trying to find an old boom microphone that I can plug into a computer. So hopefully this is working well.

00:02:02:28 - 00:03:06:27
James
Oh, thank you. Politics. It's totally okay if you fall asleep. I'm just kind of amazed that there's people in Spain who know who I am. Yes, baby. Yoda is my guardian angel. Mexico. I am consistently shocked. Like when I look at the analytics of where people are, like watching my videos from high seas. So like just the fact that there's anyone outside of Canada who watches my videos amazes me, let alone like Columbia and New Zealand and Argentina and Germany.

00:03:06:27 - 00:03:54:13
James
And the crap. Oh my God, it snowed in Minnesota. It's been raining here all day, so I guess that's some. I haven't been enjoying the rain. I'd prefer that over snow. Many people are here. Heat. Cool. Spring. Spring day in Buenos Aires. I miss spring. Spring is like the only time of year that I actually enjoy the weather because I run really hot.

00:03:54:13 - 00:04:48:02
James
So I'm always super hot in the summer and super cold in the winter. And then fall can never decide what it wants to be here. So spring is the only time of year that I actually like the weather. I haven't sweater weather in Virginia. I have not gotten to wear a sweater yet. I've been going to work in t shirts because even though there's air conditioning at work, it's just too damn hot sometimes.

00:04:48:02 - 00:05:15:08
James
It got here early with not expecting that I'm doing pretty good today other than my my fighting with YouTube to make my camera work because this is just on a crappy webcam. I wanted to be using this, which is the camera I shoot my videos with. So it's like, Oh, it'll be like high quality. It will look good.

00:05:15:15 - 00:05:35:16
James
But no, I need to buy some kind of pass through device thing to turn it into a webcam. And I was about to order one on Amazon, but they're all sold out. So if I'm going to continue doing any kind of stream things, that's something I'm going to have to find. And then I run around with my microphones.

00:05:36:26 - 00:06:24:10
James
Now, I'm usually really good with technology, except when I'm trying something new. Apparently. How's everyone else doing on this? Well, it's dark here now, so it's night, but evening. Good. At least I sound good. This was. I was like, I need a decent microphone because I was. I was even using my AirPods and they were not giving me the sound that I wanted because once the is up, I think this will just go up on YouTube.

00:06:24:10 - 00:07:28:26
James
And in my experience, most people just listen to my videos anyway. So as long as it sounds good, how do you find a vampire cult? I feel like that would be very interesting. I think you can. So I've been I've been exposed to plenty of cults in my life, but I've never met a vampire. One sad face or Windsor.

00:07:31:17 - 00:08:27:20
James
Hmm. I don't know. I haven't. I haven't been around Canada enough, so I will. I will defer to your judgment, Amber. I'm sure the whatever city is the worst city in Canada, it's probably in Ontario. Oh, boys in the band. Did you watch the original one or the the new one on Netflix? Yeah, the original one came out in 68 or 69 or maybe 1970.

00:08:27:20 - 00:08:56:01
James
In that area. It was bad timing because I think it was right after Stonewall. And so because the movie is really or this it was a play is really kind of depressing and gays just being mean to each other. The 1970. Yeah the play was in 68 and right after Stonewall, you know, gay people were kind of like, All right, we're sick of just being depressed all the time.

00:08:56:20 - 00:09:35:11
James
And then the movie came out. It was like, Well, here's your gay movie for the depressed gays. Don't worry, Debbie, you haven't missed anything. I didn't want to start answering any of the questions until the actual time I need to watch the Netflix one. I've been focused so much on writing stuff that I haven't been watching any of my Netflix things.

00:09:35:21 - 00:10:30:15
James
I haven't even I haven't gotten to watch Ratchet yet. And so I have a huge backlog that I have to get through because apparently in a quarantine, I don't have time to just sit down and watch TV. So you if you listen, if you listen to the podcast, you know who Nick is. I just got a text message from him saying I downloaded a porn game on my computer and it won't let me open the typical kind of text messages I get from my friends.

00:10:43:01 - 00:11:33:18
James
My favorite horror movie is definitely Scream. No, maybe not. Between Scream and Wes Craven's New Nightmare Scream, because it's it's technically a horror movie. You know, it's technically a slasher movie, but it's closer to something that Agatha Christie would write. So it's kind of like it's a cut above the other horror slasher movies anyway. You know, you get horror movies like The Exorcist to get Best Picture nominations and stuff, But and The Exorcist is really good, But Scream is just my favorite.

00:11:33:18 - 00:12:27:22
James
And Wes Craven's now Wes Craven's New Nightmare kind of led up to scream as being, you know, this sort of meta commentary on horror movies and how they affect people and stuff like that. That's a good question, Allison. If you notice the gay porn video, my face is not there because I was thoroughly convinced that making a video about gay porn and having my face on it would get me fired from my job or something like that recently found out that my direct boss, the CEO of my company and the other people in the department I work in have all watched it and loved it.

00:12:27:22 - 00:12:55:09
James
So that was not necessary. But starting out I was just doing voice stuff like if you go way back like six or seven years ago, I was doing little five minute videos about Marvel stuff and DC and stuff like that. My face wasn't there and the only reason that I kind of did it for Monsters in the Closet was because I was becoming obsessed with Lindsay Ellis and she's usually in her videos.

00:12:55:09 - 00:13:37:06
James
So I was like, This is how you do video essays. And then it just kind of went from there, which I mean, after getting death threats, you'd think I would have maybe not put my face in deep cuts, especially as much as I did. But, you know, that happens. I've inherently. Oh, thank you. I've actually out of all of the videos I've made, that's the one I've oddly gotten the most positive feedback about, not even necessarily on YouTube.

00:13:37:06 - 00:13:57:28
James
Like there's lots of people saying nice things about it on YouTube, but I've gotten messages on Twitter and stuff from people who work in the porn industry who and like sex workers and stuff saying, you know, thank you for, you know, not treating us like, you know, social outcasts for sort of telling our stories in a in a decent way.

00:13:58:06 - 00:14:23:29
James
And, you know, it seems like you actually care about us and stuff. And I was like that that meant so much to me because I just I feel like there shouldn't be that kind of stigma against people who work in porn and like the sex industry in general. Yeah, I got death threats very randomly for very stupid reason.

00:14:24:18 - 00:14:56:11
James
There was not going to I'm not going to say her name, but there was someone who called me out for what's the word? Um. Oh, I can't remember the word. Basically copying someone else's work for my Disney video. Because the video is based on a book. And I had credited to him the author in the actual credits, and I had done it in the description, but I hadn't plagiarism.

00:14:56:12 - 00:15:10:09
James
That's it. Yes, but I hadn't put his name at the front of it or anything like that. So you had to wait for the credits to see it or you had to go down to the description and, you know, she kind of called me out on Twitter for it and stuff, even though I had gotten permission from the author.

00:15:11:05 - 00:15:51:20
James
And one of her followers decided to get in contact with me and had found my LinkedIn profile and with my resume. So they knew my address and stuff and was like death threats. I can't remember the exact wording, but basically said, you know, this is the kind of thing that, you know, people should be executed for. And so I just I took the video down, put the video back up with the author's name upfront, which he was actually really frustrated that I had to do that because he was really happy that it was that it had as many views as it did because it had over 100,000 views.

00:15:53:26 - 00:16:26:06
James
But, you know, I would rather have less views and not death threats. Yeah, it is kind of excessive. Even if I had like not credited him at all and just been like, oh, yes, these are all my thoughts. I feel like I feel like a death threat is a bit excessive for that. Oh, thank you, Jeff. It means a lot, I think.

00:16:28:16 - 00:16:55:05
James
Yeah, my mental health is pretty okay. It's it's I'm, I'm in a weird situation because this year, you know, this year has been terrible for most people with the coronavirus and with the sort of political situation in a lot of places. And this has kind of been my best year in a long time. You know, I have a job that I really enjoy.

00:16:55:15 - 00:17:46:14
James
I was working on some short films and stuff before the coronavirus happened, and then I YouTube decided to start pushing monsters in the closet, and now I have awesome subscribers and fans and stuff. So it's like I've had this awesome year when everyone else is doing not great. So I feel kind of really privileged with that. I am usually obsessed with the Oscars and awards season, like the way straight guys are obsessed with football, but this year it's completely up in the air because they they've changed the rules a couple of times.

00:17:46:21 - 00:18:11:19
James
What movies are going to be nominated are completely up in the air because it's basically going to end up if they keep the same rules as usual, it's going to end up being just the Netflix awards. So it's the only one that I'm sure of is Chadwick Boseman is going to get best supporting actor for the Five Bloods.

00:18:11:19 - 00:18:59:09
James
I'm 100% sure of that. I'm supposed to be answering patron questions before anyone else is okay, everyone hold off on your questions. I'm going to start answering the patron questions now. Oh, my God, Mike. Thank you. That is so nice of you. I'm. Thank you. But, yeah, I'm going to answer the patron questions. And once I'm done, there, I will answer everyone else's questions.

00:18:59:09 - 00:19:36:18
James
I have nowhere to be so I can be here as long as it takes to get everyone's questions answered. So yeah, I will start with the patron questions. Now, the first one to people ask this Jack and Frank both asked what my favorite band or musician is, and now it's kind of basic, but I think it's Lady Gaga because she is really eclectic and she can basically, you know, she can sing country jazz, rock, pop and, you know, just kind of adore her as a person.

00:19:38:04 - 00:20:16:09
James
So. Oh, Brendon Urie is amazing. Let's see here. Have them all written down and now I can't. Okay, So Andrew asked, covering LGBTQ plus in media, is there any possibilities at the history of our influence in music? So covering our history of influence in music, I think that would be really interesting to cover. It would definitely be a copyright nightmare since YouTube kind of goes after audio before anything else.

00:20:19:27 - 00:20:48:11
James
But that's that's definitely something that I have a growing, very extensive growing list. But that's something that I would definitely love to to get to. Oh, don't worry, I'm going to go over the patron questions first, but then I'm going to jump back in here. So everyone just hold your questions for now and then we can start talking about all sorts of other stuff.

00:20:48:22 - 00:21:28:14
James
And also, you know, if you have comments and stuff based on the patron questions, by all means. Okay. So Hannah asks if you had the opportunity to make a full length Netflix documentary, what would you cover in it and who would you want to bring in to help Star? So she has two questions. That was first one, I would either do a, you know, three hour long documentary about gay horror because there's a I would love to bring in people in the industry to actually talk about that.

00:21:28:14 - 00:22:01:02
James
I would love to interview Clive Barker, for instance. So would either be that or the ten part documentary series about the history of gay porn, because there is so much like the videos 90 minutes long and there is so much that I don't even touch on that it's a ten part series would even be conservative because they're even just the original script.

00:22:02:13 - 00:22:24:03
James
When I recorded excuse me, when I recorded the original audio, it came in a two and a half hours and even that wasn't including a whole lot. So that is if I could just make sign a carte blanche deal with Netflix, that's what I would do. And a second question was, will you ever collab with Cold Crush Pictures?

00:22:24:03 - 00:22:54:10
James
I feel like you guys would be an awesome duo. That would be a lot of fun because we kind of have a lot in common for our dorky interests. I would be incredible. I probably wouldn't be very good to work with though, because I have a major crush on him and so I probably would just be blushing the entire time and not know how to talk to him.

00:22:57:14 - 00:23:26:17
James
So I don't know how I would react with that, but I would definitely like definitely love to to work with him. He's really cool and we have a lot of the same interests and his recent video on musicals, I was like, Damn, I wish I had done something like that. So Cameron asks, What is the best Star Wars movie in your opinion?

00:23:27:29 - 00:24:07:16
James
Cameron I don't know if you're in the chat, but are you trying to get me killed? Star Wars is like the most dangerous phantom right now. I think the best Star Wars movie is honestly, The Last Jedi. I think that that and the Empire Strikes Back are ones that you can sit down without any context. You don't have to know about anything else in Star Wars.

00:24:07:16 - 00:24:27:04
James
And you can you can watch it and enjoy it. And maybe if you do too, you do know too much about Star Wars. Maybe you won't. But I've been a star Wars fan my entire life since I was a kid, like seven years old. I think when I started watching Star Wars, I stood in line for the Empire Strikes Back, not the Empire Strikes Back, Phantom Menace with my dad.

00:24:28:26 - 00:24:54:18
James
So like I am a huge Star Wars fan and the last Jedi is the best one. Sorry to the people who hate it, but it is the best one. And I'm really sad that Rian Johnson didn't get to do the third movie because I feel like the third movie would have been good had he actually gotten to do it instead of the disaster that it was.

00:24:56:03 - 00:25:25:24
James
Because it was a disaster. It came out a year ago. I felt like I feel like that was ten years ago that that came out okay. Next question. Spencer asks Any personal recommendations? No. Wrong one. Sorry, I will get to Spencer North Monkey asks, Have you ever considered writing about the history of the role of mental asylums in curing homosexuality and how that evolved into the current idea around conversion therapy?

00:25:26:03 - 00:25:48:29
James
Yes, that is actually on my list of videos that I'm going to make, not in the immediate future because I have two depressing videos already lined up. I'm trying to get a happy one for December because my next one is about the history of the gay panic defense, which is basically the history of getting away with gay bashing.

00:25:49:20 - 00:26:13:26
James
And then in January, I'm going to be covering I'm going to be doing a video about the gay victims of the Holocaust. So I'm trying to find something happy in December. And that is definitely not the gays being put in asylums, but that is on my list. I need to have a look at the chats before I keep going.

00:26:14:03 - 00:26:46:14
James
I feel like I might be missing something. Yes. I'm so glad so many of you like The Last Jedi. I got ripped apart online for defending that movie so much people saying, Oh, you're an SJW, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, No, the only thing I didn't like the I didn't like Finn's subplot about the Rich Planet thing. I thought that that was cool, but it didn't quite mesh with the rest of the movie.

00:26:48:02 - 00:27:31:15
James
I thought it could have been a different movie, but just you cannot argue with the craft of the filmmaking. In The Last Jedi, it is just above and beyond every other Star Wars movie. Every other Star Wars movie feels like a Star Wars movie. And The Last Jedi feels like, you know, a film like to be pretentious. It feels like in 20, 30, 40 years, whatever it could be in that kind of cinematic, the same kind of cinematic thought process as like Lawrence of Arabia and stuff like that.

00:27:31:15 - 00:28:18:25
James
It just looks so amazing. I mean, just the scene of the the, the Lightspeed attack on the Star Destroyer that best 15 seconds of Star Wars like, no, I am your father is can't compare nothing nothing can compare to those that that sudden silence nothing can compare to that in my opinion by bubble t I completely agree. Finn's character had so much potential and they just dropped him.

00:28:19:03 - 00:28:44:00
James
They they did. John Boyega so dirty. He had so much potential, even after the Last Jedi. Like he still had so much potential. And even like, even if they ignored the Finn Poe stuff, they could have still done something amazing with him. And they just had him, you know, spinning his wheels in episode nine. It was terrible. Yes, The Stormtrooper revolt.

00:28:44:00 - 00:29:17:07
James
That's what should have happened. He should, yes. But Star Wars frustrates me so much now. Oh pose plot in in episode eight where he's just kind of like blatantly angry and then his plot in episode nine where they're like, see he's you see he's straight. Yeah. There's a girlfriend type person. See, he's straight like, Oh, piss off. Yeah.

00:29:21:18 - 00:29:58:21
James
All right, more questions. So Spencer asks any personal recommendations for gay history or culture books? Yes, I read a lot. I have like seven or eight bookshelves filled with books that I've bought in the last five years that I've read in the last five years, and a giant just boxes of books at home in my parents place. It's kind of bad habit.

00:29:58:21 - 00:30:32:21
James
I've gotten into collecting hardcover books, but yes, I do have some recommendations for really good gay history and culture books. The first one is, and the band played on by Randy Schulz, that kind of chronicles the early years of the HIV pandemic and leading up to the first real treatments. It's really interesting because in the book he gets into detail on how it kind of evolved as a disease, like in the 1800s.

00:30:32:21 - 00:31:09:29
James
What didn't just pop up in the 1960s and seventies and stuff. So that's really interesting. Randy Shilts has another book, The Mayor of Castro Street, that is a very lengthy examination of the life of Harvey Milk. So that one's also really good. The Celluloid Closet by Vito Russo is basically required reading if you are gay. And like movies a lot a lot of people have, you know, pointed out that big sections of my unrequited video, which was one video, now it's a series.

00:31:12:23 - 00:31:44:15
James
The first part, a lot of it comes from the Celluloid Closet. And that's because it is the ultimate kind of the ultimate history of gay film history. Prior to the nineties. After that. This isn't quite gay history, but Redefining Realness by Janet Mock is a great book. She's a trans woman who she she works with Ryan Murphy now.

00:31:45:27 - 00:32:56:21
James
She's one of the head writers and directors on Pose. She is amazing. Her story is fantastic. She's incredibly talented. And if you if you want to if you know someone who's kind of trying to figure out the whole idea of being transgender and trying to wrap their head around that, you know, get them to read this book, and then a book that I just recently read branded by the Pink Triangle, is an examination of the Nazis crimes against gay people in Germany, which that was a big influence on me deciding to do the gay Holocaust video in January and that's by Ken centering ten ETR in ghetto in No Mike I have I have avoided

00:32:56:21 - 00:33:48:06
James
them like the plague the books Angel The books is called Redefining Realness by Janet Mock. The best way to get in touch with me would probably be Twitter. Not a message on Twitter, though, like actually just tweeting at me because I actually see those Twitter constantly hides DMS. So I almost I will check I will check my DMS and see, oh, there's like eight messages that I'm not allowed to see because I don't follow them.

00:33:48:06 - 00:34:20:23
James
And then I go in and it's like messages from five months ago. So the next question. SS Leif asks, got any book or film recommendations like Feel Good, Queer stuff? Feel good, Queer stuff is hard to come by even today. But I do have some boyfriend material by Alexis Hall is a fantastic book. I read it recently and for the first time in like ten years it made me want to have a boyfriend.

00:34:21:13 - 00:34:52:03
James
Didn't last. But the book is hilarious. It's very British. It's romantic, but not in a sappy, painful way. It's really fun. Red, White and Royal Blue by Casey Mcquiston is another book that is about the son, the gay son of the president of the United States, falling in love with an English prince. And that sounds ridiculous, but it's actually incredibly well-written and very smart.

00:34:55:27 - 00:35:22:04
James
Casey obviously did a lot of research into like how the politics of that situation would work conventionally. Yours by Annabeth. Albert is a really cute book that I just read and The Fell of Dark by Caleb ROHRIG. I think that's how you say his last name. That's one of multiple books of his that I've read. And they are all good, but that's probably the happiest one he's written.

00:35:23:04 - 00:35:57:24
James
I kind of compare his books to basically being gay versions of Gillian Flynn novels like Gone Girl, Dark Places, Sharp Objects, stuff like that. Upbeat, happy gay movies are harder to come by. So the only ones I can really recommend that aren't likely to make you depressed at all would be The Birdcage. Priscilla Queen of the Desert Where the World Mine.

00:35:57:24 - 00:36:34:20
James
Alex Strangelove. Booksmart. Rocketman might get you depressed in some points, but it has a happy ending, so I feel like it evens out and just kind of lends hope to my Please let Taron Edgerton be gay. Dreams. So I think Love Simon kind of fits into a weird area because there's a lot of like it has a happy ending, but during the story of the movie, there are some like downbeat parts.

00:36:35:00 - 00:37:07:05
James
And so I was trying to think like, okay, what are some movies that you're not going to have to deal with? Emotions other than happiness. It's okay, Let's see. Okay, so buy bubble tea asks Who do you think is the most interesting figure or time period in LGBT history to learn about? And what aspect of LGBT culture or history interests you the most?

00:37:07:12 - 00:37:41:21
James
To make videos about? So I think the most interesting time period, which is something that I haven't really gotten to cover yet, is the 1920s. To Wong Foo. Yes, to Wong Foo is very, very good. But yeah, I think the most interesting period in queer history is the 1920s. I think that you know, no one really talks about it, but in Harlem for instance, it was like, Oh, you're gay, all right, you're gay.

00:37:43:25 - 00:38:13:25
James
In Germany at the time, they were actually, like discussing the government of the Weimer Republic. Germany was actually discussing like not just legalizing being gay, but actually legalizing like gay marriages and stuff like that. It was especially Germany was incredibly progressive on the topic at that point. And then the Nazis came in and threw it out the window as conservative started to do.

00:38:16:04 - 00:38:24:13
James
But it wasn't just Germany, it was all over the place. And then the depression happened and all the progress that gay people were making was just tossed out the window.

00:38:28:06 - 00:39:14:14
James
Most interesting person I would say would be Larry Kramer. I think he is the biggest bad ass in gay history. If you don't know a lot about him, watch the HBO show. HBO movie The Normal Heart. Read about him. He was kind of a queer philosopher at first, and then HIV happened and he just turned into this bad ass who not only was going after the government and going after the people in power, but actually going after the gay community and saying, Hey, you have to take this seriously to.

00:39:15:00 - 00:39:49:24
James
And he only died recently. And he's just like at least in like recent history, he's so much respect for that man. Some historical people that I find really interesting are Da Vinci, who nobody nobody acknowledges that Da Vinci was gay. They there was a show about Da Vinci not long ago that turned him into a womanizer. That just infuriated me.

00:39:51:22 - 00:40:23:20
James
But he was gay. He was actually repulsed by the thought of sleeping with women. He had multiple gay lovers. He was really into twinks. And another person who nobody talks about is Richard, the first of England who had a very long love affair with Philip, the second of France, and he never, ever slept in the same bed as the Queen of England at the time.

00:40:24:06 - 00:40:53:16
James
But he and Philip had a special room in the palace that was just theirs. And of course, you know, there there were good friends who only slept in the same bed together all the time. But, you know, he's gay. Potpourri asks, Have you seen the haunting of Bly Manor yet? If so, thoughts? I haven't. I've been waiting. That's on my list.

00:40:53:16 - 00:41:25:25
James
I want to watch that on Halloween, so I will let you know what I think on November 1st. Laura asks, which have been some of the most formative queer media that you have consumed over the years. What made you first feel represented? What made you want to start doing video essays and analysis? Queer as Folk is probably the formative, most formative queer media for me.

00:41:28:19 - 00:42:01:06
James
I lucked into it by accident. One night I was How old was I? I think I was 11 and I was laying in bed. I TV in my room. So I was flipping through TV. The the American one Mike The British one's also really good, but the American one is the one that I, I saw first. And I was scrolling through the channels because I couldn't sleep and suddenly I saw two men kissing and so I was like, what?

00:42:01:06 - 00:42:24:14
James
And flipped back and I was like, Oh, this must be like a movie from Europe. And then they start talking and I'm like, Oh no, this is like North American. Okay? And the they showed the first three episodes at once in Canada. And so I was like, okay, it's a, it's a movie because it just showed it on the the TV guide thing.

00:42:25:11 - 00:42:57:12
James
And then it was not a movie, it was a TV show. And I never missed an episode. And that was huge for me because up until that point I knew I was gay. I was already out to some people, some friends from school and stuff, but I was like borderline homophobic. Like the idea of feminine gay people really me off and I was like, They're the reason that gay people don't have rights it and you know, the character of Emmett on Queer.

00:42:57:12 - 00:43:23:20
James
So kind of made me realize, Oh, you're being an asshole. And gay people can be masculine or feminine. They can fit in any kind of box and they can still be awesome. So grow up. And I did now, I was 11 when the show came on, so had a lot of growing up to do. It was more to that question, so that that's definitely what made me first feel represented.

00:43:27:26 - 00:44:03:27
James
Oh my God. Dark Road, The I cannot hear the song Save the Last Dance for Me Without crying. To this day, like 20 years later. Can't ask what made me want to do video essays. I did the short little ones years ago and that was kind of based off of stuff that Bob Chipman was doing for The Escapist.

00:44:04:14 - 00:44:27:20
James
And because I was like, Oh, this, you know, I've gone to film school, I've done all of this. So now I can, you know, have an excuse to make little things. And then, you know, that kind of died off and then I discovered Lindsay Ellis and binged all of her videos. This was when the nostalgia chick stuff was still up.

00:44:27:20 - 00:44:46:03
James
So I watched all of those, watched all of her new essays and was like, I want to do something like that. And I couldn't really think of anything. And then the idea for Monsters, The Closet came to mind because I was like, There's no real like documentaries or or anything out there about this. And then that just kind of started that.

00:44:46:03 - 00:45:29:03
James
So I only started doing video essays because of because of Lindsay Allison's stuff and kind of watching her evolve and everyone else, like counterpoints in philosophy tube and watching the the the ever increase in quality of their videos, not just from the writing but from the production standpoint as kind of like if you if you watch my gay history of gay baiting videos and then you watch my video my most recent video you see a big jump in production quality because I actually, you know, over three months I was like, I'm going to give a damn.

00:45:29:03 - 00:46:08:23
James
And I have these look, okay, almost through the patron questions and then we can get to everyone in the chat. Jerry asks if you could choose one person alive or dead to have dinner date with, who would it be and why? And yes, I know this an original question. If it's someone, if it's like a dinner date to just talk to, um, Orson Welles.

00:46:08:23 - 00:46:42:27
James
So I'd really like to pick his brain on filmmaking if it's a dinner date for someone that I would like to, you know, have more than one date with, that would probably be. Hmm. I don't know, because I have a crush on a lot of people, but they all tend to end up being straight. So I'm not sure about that one.

00:46:47:18 - 00:47:32:19
James
Okay. Yonatan asks, What are some of your favorite examples of queer media that make you feel simply happy? Hmm. Or queer media that just makes me happy would be. Hmm. See, there's so little queer media that just makes me happy. Unless you count books. There's a lot of gay books that I read that just make me happy. It doesn't really count as queer.

00:47:32:26 - 00:48:09:12
James
I mean, there's, you know, the gay couple in it, but Grace and Frankie on Netflix, I watch that whenever I feel down because it's I think it's so funny. And Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are just icons. And so that's that's usually what I go to to feel happy. Yeah. And like certain anime that's not very gay, but they didn't mean it to be gay, but it was like Gundam Wing.

00:48:10:10 - 00:48:49:06
James
Oh, Golden Girls. Yes. See, that's another thing that's like, not technically queer, but we've kind of adopted it. So it's, it's, it's queer. Now. And the last one called whether Kate asks, Have any of your coworkers or family members come across your channel on their own? None of my family members have that I know of. But like I mentioned earlier, my boss, the CEO of the company I work for and my coworkers in my department have all come across my YouTube channel and watch the videos and really love it.

00:48:49:06 - 00:49:14:20
James
My, my, my boss is even to the point where I was editing deep cuts at work in my office. And because I just take my laptop, I use my personal laptop for work and I had nothing else to do. So editing it, it kind of came in and saw and he was like, What are you doing? Oh, I'm editing a video for the YouTubes.

00:49:15:20 - 00:49:42:15
James
And he's like, Well, you better get to it. I'm like, Oh, all right then. So I can't really use work as a as an excuse for not getting videos done on time. So that's the end of the patron questions. So now let's I will answer any questions I can possibly see in the chat as long as it doesn't go by too quick.

00:49:42:15 - 00:50:24:22
James
I wonder if I can like change the time how fast the chat moves. No. Okay. All right. Yes. Scroll up. Okay, let's see. How far do I need to scroll? Probably pretty far. Just I did it at. Oh, no, I can't find any of the questions. There is like a big line of them, and now they're all gone.

00:50:25:24 - 00:50:54:15
James
Um, Morgan. Morgan. Robin said that they would love to see me talk about queer history in gaming, and that's. That's in the works. I've got about 5000 words written of that, but I want to talk to some people in the industry before I go forward just to kind of lock it in before I finish, before I write probably another 10,000 words of that.

00:50:56:16 - 00:51:41:15
James
See, am I an X-Men fan? Yes. I've loved the X-Men ever since I was a kid. I'm currently hardcore fighting for Colton Haynes to be cast as Iceman in the Marvel Disney X-Men movies. If Disney grows some balls and will actually let Iceman be gay. Because right now, in my mind, I'm pretty sure they're just going to not put him in the movie so they don't have to say that they straight washed him.

00:51:45:14 - 00:52:24:11
James
See? Oh. Oh. I don't like how this chat works. Do you think Marvel is going to do Wicked and Hulk Wing Justice? I actually don't know much about Blink, so I don't know what to say there. As for Wicked and Hulk playing yesterday, they announced an actress who's going to be in Doctor Strange two. She is Latina and she's probably going to be playing Miss America.

00:52:24:15 - 00:52:57:00
James
Eric Chavez, who is a part of the Young Avengers. She's 14. And I'm worried a part of me is worried that they will for the young Avengers, they are going to cast them young enough that they can say, Oh, we don't need to deal with the gay stuff because they're too young. The other part of me, the film brain part of me says a young Avengers movie is probably not going to come out for four years, so like three at the best case scenario.

00:52:57:05 - 00:53:16:07
James
So that will be aged up. And I have faith in Kevin Feige. He has not done me wrong yet. So whether or not Wiccan and Hulk Klinger done right, I think will not be a decision made by Marvel Studios because I think Kevin Foggy will do the right thing. I think it will be a decision coming down from Disney.

00:53:16:19 - 00:53:59:06
James
So it's whether or not Disney allows them to actually be done properly, which I don't have a whole lot of faith in. I don't have a whole lot of faith in Disney. I know what that was. They should let you, like, highlight things to come back to. Oh, it does. Okay. Well, I will remember that for the next time I do this.

00:54:05:20 - 00:54:06:27
James
Do I like Minecraft?

00:54:08:28 - 00:54:52:15
James
I've put literally thousands devours into Minecraft building parts of Middle Earth. I've built Hogwarts like six times, making it more detailed each time. I have spent way too much time playing Minecraft because I used to just start playing, put on a podcast and then I would just kind of disappear for 8 hours. And then after 8 hours, oh, I built a star destroyer doll.

00:54:52:15 - 00:55:18:29
James
I actually haven't seen boys in the band yet. I saw the original, but I haven't seen the new one yet. It's on my to watch list. It's it looks really good. The cast. I mean, I'll watch anything with Zachary Quinto in it, so. But I mean, it just it looks so good. And everything Ryan Murphy has done for Netflix, I've adored like if you haven't watched Hollywood, go watch it.

00:55:18:29 - 00:55:49:07
James
It's amazing. So that, that and there's so many things that I need to watch. I've been spending so much time over the last couple of weeks just reading depressing, gay bashing stories for the next video that I would really need to take a break and just go watch some TV top animated crushes Gohan from Dragon Ball Z go on and trunks, both of them.

00:55:50:11 - 00:56:29:13
James
Trunks because he's hot and has a sword. And I had a huge crush on him as a kid and Gohan who I have a crush on now because he's nerdy and really smart and that's like perfection. Okay, knock on when he was a kid. Go on when he's an adult. And basically everyone in Gundam Wing, the five guys in Gundam Wing.

00:56:30:27 - 00:56:56:12
James
Look, if I didn't already know I was gay when I watched Gundam Wing, that would have kind of just dropped kicked me into homosexuality. I haven't watched Ratchet yet either. That's another one on my list. I saw a bunch of people complaining, giving it bad reviews, saying that it's basically just a season of American Horror Story, which is like, Why is that a bad thing?

00:56:57:14 - 00:57:41:06
James
I have not dislike a season of American Horror Story yet, so the only one that I didn't finish watching Cult, but I've loved the rest of them so. Oh my God, don't say that. I like lots of Harlequins I I'm like 5050 on the Margot Robbie one but I think the Harley Quinn cartoon that's out now is hilarious.

00:57:41:06 - 00:58:25:06
James
I think she's great. Am I going to buy Hogwarts Legacy? I'm No, I have. It's really depressing. I've basically abandoned I haven't abandoned my love of Harry Potter, but I've really I'm not going to spend any more money on it. I've spent well over $1,000 just on Harry Potter Lego building, Hogwarts piece by piece. I've bought the books multiple times, the movies multiple times.

00:58:25:06 - 00:58:50:16
James
I've put so much money in her pockets and it's just like I can't do that anymore. Even though I think Hogwarts legacy looks like it could be fun and yeah, I just, I, I know like she it's not she's already been paid for the game. The game's success does not give her any money the way the contract is for her.

00:58:50:16 - 00:59:17:13
James
They have not she gets no more money from that. They, she got the licensing money upfront. So you know if it sells two copies or 2 million, it's she's not going to make a dime extra, but just sort of by the game being successful, it tells other companies that basically people are okay with what she's doing and I can't be a part of that.

00:59:17:26 - 01:00:03:11
James
So hopefully she'll come around and be a normal person and stop being so damn hateful. But as of right now she is on my shit list. It's probably stay in there. Oh, I would probably pirate the game too, but I don't know how to pirate something for PlayStation and there's probably not going to be a mac port. So.

01:00:06:29 - 01:00:44:19
James
Oh, I have seen Circus of Books. It was so good. There were some parts that I felt awkward just because it was so sad, but it was really well made and I really liked it. I am. And that's, you know, I, I yeah, it's fine. I am someone who is not against pirating something if you are morally, if you want something and you're morally against giving that particular person money.

01:00:46:25 - 01:01:13:24
James
For instance, the new Mulan movie, I was not the way Disney Plus had that set up where you had to be a Disney Plus member and then it was 2999 for the movie. I am not a Disney Plus member right now because it's there's nothing on it worth watching. And it was in 2999 and candidate was 3999 plus the Disney Plus subscription, which was like 16 or something like that.

01:01:14:01 - 01:01:41:21
James
So it was like 50 some dollars to watch Mulan. And I was like, No. So I did pirate that and it was sucked. So it didn't suck, but it was not good. And politically it was very unwise. A lot of the stuff in that movie and the the By Erasure is very annoying because it's 2020 like it made no money in China anyway, because China has its own film industry.

01:01:41:21 - 01:02:15:18
James
They don't need Disney's castoffs. So they they don't need to, you know, go see the Disney version of Mulan. When there's a Chinese version of Mulan, they can they can see it. So I've been hearing like I've been hearing some nasty things about the second season of The Mandalorian. I have. No, this is not confirmed at all. So take it with a grain of salt.

01:02:15:18 - 01:02:46:26
James
But I've heard that Mando is actually only in about half of it because they wanted to put more weight behind the characters coming over from Rebels and Clone Wars. And so that's kind of it's kind of shitty. And they wouldn't let Pedro Pascal. Apparently they won't let them take the helmet off at all. And he's like, Well, why am I here?

01:02:47:09 - 01:03:24:10
James
You know, I could just be doing this as a voice role. So I just some favorite books with gay characters. I have not read the Green Creek series, but I just read The Extraordinary by T.J. Clune, and it was fantastic. So I am going to be kind of seeking out other stuff that he's he's written, but favorite books with gay characters.

01:03:24:10 - 01:04:02:03
James
I've read so many recently, Black Wings Beating and its sequels, Red Sky's Falling, Gold Wings Rising, Fantastic High Fantasy series with two lead characters. One is a brother and sister, and the brother is gay and aptly outwardly gay. He has multiple boyfriends throughout the series that see everything that Caleb ROHRIG has written. These Violent Delights is a book I just read that it is not a field goal feelgood book.

01:04:02:03 - 01:04:49:20
James
It is dark, very kind of psychologically messed up. But it is. Yeah. If you're into that, it is fantastic, really well-written, but probably my favorite everything. Also everything. Christopher Rice is written, but probably my favorite book with gay characters is the song of Achilles. I lucked into finding that in the bookstore, and I'm kind of a Greek mythology nerd, so I just got it because I was like, Oh, it's a book about Achilles, not knowing that it was the love story of Achilles and Patrick lists and then just balled my eyes out at the end of that book, I cried for days.

01:04:50:02 - 01:05:20:25
James
It was just airball. Which countries would I like to visit? Germany for sure. I've never left Canada, which is sad, but I would love to visit Germany. My history nerd is just like, you know, you've got to go see the Brandenburg Gate, you've got to go to the camps, you've got to see the remnants of the Berlin Wall.

01:05:20:25 - 01:06:07:23
James
There's so much there. England and Wales, especially, especially Wales. I would love to visit Japan. I would love to visit California and oddly, Dallas. Dallas, Texas, for reasons I can't even explain. I've just always wanted to visit Dallas. I almost went to film school in Texas, so that would have gotten awkward. Morgan There's lots of places in the U.S. I'd like to visit the country in general right now.

01:06:07:23 - 01:06:42:19
James
No, because I don't like coronavirus or the current president or the probably next president. But yeah, I don't know why. Austin and Dallas in Texas, I've always wanted to visit. Not sure why I was this close to going to film school in Austin, but it cost like $15,000 more a year to go to film school there than it did here.

01:06:43:06 - 01:07:15:17
James
So I just went here, Australia to and New Zealand. I'd love to visit New Zealand to see where they shot Lord of the Rings. That would be amazing any more money? So I could go visit places and the coronavirus needs to piss off so I can travel because I've never gotten to travel in my life. I'm finally at a point where I actually could travel if I wanted to and everything is shut down.

01:07:15:28 - 01:07:41:19
James
So can LGBT representation ever be forced, or is that just a homophobic dog whistle? Totally a dog whistle. One of the things that annoys me the most is when people are like, Oh my God, they made this character gay. They should have just, you know, created a gay character. And I just want to hit them and be like, You realize that people come out all the time.

01:07:42:00 - 01:07:57:09
James
Like, people just don't come out when they're 15. They do it in their twenties and their thirties and their forties and their fifties. They do it after they've been married for ten years. They do it after they've had kids, grandkids. Anyone can come out as gay at any time. So yeah, it would be cool if a character was gay from the from the front.

01:07:57:15 - 01:08:28:14
James
But just by making a character gay is not forcing gay characters. It's just drives me nuts. Oh, San Francisco. I'd also love to visit San Francisco. Oddly, not for I would love to visit during Folsom, just to kind of see it, not to partake in anything, but just to kind of see it. And San Francisco, you know, so much of Anne Rice is books take place in San Francisco.

01:08:28:14 - 01:08:56:15
James
So I've got kind of this mental image. And Nick's first book that comes out in March actually takes place in San Francisco as well. Dark Road. Yes, I read it in City of Souls in one sitting when I was 14 or 15. I read the Snow Garden first and then I read A Density of Souls. And I've it's one of the rare books I've read multiple times.

01:08:56:15 - 01:09:31:11
James
I've read it probably six times like that Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. The only things that I've read multiple times, and some of the Vampire Chronicles Nick's book is called Avalon Knight Gentlemen's Club. It's not up for preorder yet. The preorder link, I don't know when the preorder link will be available, but I'm going to try and help him get.

01:09:31:17 - 01:10:14:03
James
He sucks at social media, so I'm going to try and help him get get some traction on that once the link is actually up. Which subject would I love to make a video about? But it's kind of lazy to do gay TV. That was something that after Monsters in the Closet when I was putting up sort of polls on YouTube, on Twitter, before I had the YouTube community tab, I'm saying like, what would you like my next video to be?

01:10:14:12 - 01:10:37:24
James
The history of gay TV was one of them, and I would love to do it because it's I've watched all of these shows, but I do think it would be pretty lazy because it would just be like, here I'm going to talk about shows that you've probably watched and not really inform of anything, but I'm going to talk about this for an hour and a half, so I feel like that would be lazy on my part.

01:10:38:00 - 01:11:11:13
James
People might want to see it, but you know, it might be one of those things that I do when I'm like, It's the summer and I just don't want to do too much research. I've looked into queer history and religion, but not enough to make a video about it. I definitely need to do more research into that gay reality TV How is there a lot of gay reality TV?

01:11:11:13 - 01:11:37:15
James
I remember there being Boy Meets Boy, I think it was called and it was basically just gay. The Gay Bachelor basically. I mean, there's Drag Race, which I'm obsessed with. It's kind of hilarious because like ten years ago, I was terrified of drag queens. Terrified. I also had that stupid mindset of like, oh, drag queens make gays look bad.

01:11:39:01 - 01:12:14:12
James
And now I'm like, No, drag queens are the best people in the world and simultaneously the worst people in the world. If you believe what they are, what they say. Pedro Oh God, I can't pronounce his last name. I suck at Spanish stuff. Yes. Pedro Almodovar. Oh, God. Okay. You know who I'm talking about? Oh, he. I have seen a lot of his movies.

01:12:14:12 - 01:13:03:17
James
I think he's brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Favorite drag queens. And why is it Trixie and or Katya? Yes. I also love Miss Cracker. I think Miss Crackers. Hilarious. I actually. And Blaire Sinclair. I wrote a screenplay called Shade that is about a a drag queen and his very conservative sister on a road trip across America, specifically for Blair Sinclair to play the drag queen.

01:13:03:17 - 01:13:40:02
James
But I don't have an agent or anything, so that didn't go anywhere. But it was a good writing exercise. Andrew, I. I've thought about doing that, but I feel like I would definitely like to do a video more focused on lesbians if I was working with a lesbian, but I don't know if I would be I don't know if I would have the right not outlook, but I don't think I'd have the right experience to bring to that.

01:13:40:12 - 01:14:10:10
James
Like if there was a lesbian I could work with who, you know, maybe they don't have experience in sort of writing video essays or producing them or something like that, but they can kind of help me put it together and then I can do the production side. I would definitely do that, but I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to give anyone the impression that my experiences of what it's like to be a lesbian, which is obviously I don't have one, is what it's like.

01:14:10:20 - 01:14:57:16
James
So but I would definitely love to work with lesbian creators and stuff like that that. Yeah, I've been trying to because early on, I mean, I will very, I will admit upfront, like in my videos, I just kind of like didn't ignore but didn't think to include a whole lot of lesbian or bisexual content. And I'm trying to make up for that because, you know, if, if you know, I have 30,000 subscribers now, so that's 30,000 people that I'm reaching on a regular basis with each video.

01:14:57:16 - 01:15:41:22
James
So I feel like, you know, there is I have a responsibility to get some, you know, not lesbian representation, but acknowledge that the LGBT community is not just the gay community favorite non English speaking movie. There is a movie, I believe it's from the Czech Republic called Mander Gora. It's about four and a half hours long. It's about a gay prostitute in Prague.

01:15:42:06 - 01:16:39:02
James
And it is a fantastic movie. A beautiful movie. Really heartbreaking. But that's that's probably my favorite foreign language film. So, yeah, tweeting me is definitely the best way to actually get me to pay attention because my DMS for Twitter just I never I never get them from anyone and slightly higher quality than Bellamy. But I wouldn't be surprised if I share some of the cast of like an American in Prague or the Lucas Richardson movies.

01:16:43:13 - 01:17:25:28
James
I have an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the history of gay porn. It's kind of sad. I'm totally up for lesbians. Destroying my Twitter mentions as long as they're nice. Melissa I think niche wise, gay content is. I think that's probably what like my subscribers want to see because there's other stuff that I could talk about because I am a huge comic book nerd.

01:17:25:28 - 01:18:04:21
James
I am a huge movie nerd. Like I could cover all sorts of stuff, but I just feel like there's such a dearth of good gay content out there documenting the history of the queer experience in media, in history, stuff like that, that it's kind of my responsibility to get that stuff out there so that, you know, someone on the way I kind of think of it is if I make a video about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's just about the MCU, then, you know, it might get 100,500 million views.

01:18:04:21 - 01:18:29:17
James
Who knows? But it's just another MCU video. But if I make a video about the history of gay representation in Disney and, you know, a 12 year old who's trying to figure out who they are sees it, the impact it has on that 12 year old is way more important than the impact that an MCU video would have on a million Marvel fans.

01:18:58:19 - 01:19:33:28
James
MORGAN Yeah, I I've done a lot of sad gay reading lately and focusing on the Holocaust for my January video, partially because it's very rarely the the treatment of gays during the Holocaust is very rarely talked about, for instance, when this is kind of the saddest part. I think when people when the camps were liberated by the Americans and the British and the Russians, you know, they everyone got set free except the gays.

01:19:33:28 - 01:20:24:20
James
They got put in prison. So they just went from one person to another prison. And so I feel like, you know, we need to talk about that we need some people that we need people to know that that, you know, not everyone was liberated from the camps and the treatment of gays in Stalinist Russia was also abhorrent. And that that might be something that I cover eventually, but that I think with Stalinist Russia, it was less systemic because it was less systemic and more personal because Stalin was such a nut that he was so paranoid that he like that he had so many delusions, whereas Hitler and the Nazis, it was very organized.

01:20:26:10 - 01:21:20:18
James
And I feel like the organization of it makes it almost worse. Really. I didn't know that it was only a couple of years ago that the sentences were pardoned. I know that there is a memorial in, I think, Berlin for gay Holocaust victims, and I think it might be the only one in the world, which is also very sad and frustrating.

01:21:26:08 - 01:21:59:28
James
Yeah. MORGAN Exactly, because It wasn't just sort of with the Nazis across the board, not obviously, not just with how they treated gay people, but just the like. I work with a lot of accountants and just how it's murder was a spreadsheet to them. Whereas like they didn't know. In a lot of cases people were just identified as numbers, identify them as names.

01:21:59:28 - 01:22:20:16
James
And like I was talking about before with Stalinist Russia, Stalin knew who you were if you were getting killed. The Nazis didn't. In a lot of cases, you were just a number to them. So it makes it worse. And that's something, you know, we talk about the emotional side of the Holocaust a lot, but we don't talk about just the how fucked up some of it is.

01:22:20:16 - 01:23:10:24
James
Like when you really think about us. I actually loved Jojo Rabbit. I, I thought that movie, brilliant because it's so rare. We were very scared as a society, I find, of portraying Hitler as anything other than a monster. And we're very scared of saying that he wasn't the most competent, evil person in history where he was kind of a fool and he believed in a lot of crazy stuff, a lot of like supernatural stuff and aliens.

01:23:10:24 - 01:23:46:08
James
And it like he he was a nut. But we don't talk about that because that kind of makes him less scary, I think. But I think we should because he doesn't need to be the most scary person in the world. We can say he was an idiot and, you know, still did terrible things. Exactly how Mel Brooks portrayed Hitler is kind of what I feel like we should be, because like Lindsay Ellis did a whole video about it, how, you know, when you portray Nazis as very serious people, then it's easy to kind of deify them.

01:23:46:18 - 01:24:32:12
James
But when you portray them as jokes, it's harder to do that. It is weird. Autumn Blackstone, How how we'll remember because so many of us are already treating him like a a joke and I am kind of worried that so few people take him seriously that right now that if he steals this election coming up, it it makes me worried.

01:24:38:08 - 01:25:19:03
James
Melissa My COVID 19 experience has been interesting. I actually had it in March. I was one of the first people in my province who had it, and being asthmatic, it was really rough. But I got over it, took a couple of weeks, but I got over it and quarantine has been fine. I've had no problem, you know, self-isolating and kind of excuse me, have been kind of irritated by long wait times and stuff, but it just gives me more reasons to not leave the house.

01:25:24:26 - 01:26:26:29
James
I'm actually not sure how I caught it, to be honest. Might have been someone in my office who is asymptomatic or just, you know, walking through a cloud of sneeze in a store or something. Who knows? Oh, Jeff, Gerrymandering in the United States is ridiculous. I know way too much about the American political system to not live there, but just the like when you look at things like public support for legalizing marijuana, for gay marriage, universal health care, for universal college education, it's all like over 60, 70%, like it's all high approval ratings.

01:26:27:06 - 01:26:54:17
James
And yet somehow the people who are vehemently against it keep getting elected. It doesn't make sense. And it's because they rigged the game and I think I can't remember how the census is done, but that's how the redistricting happens. And I think it's the Senate. So the Democrats need to take the Senate. So it's and whether they will or not is kind of up in the air.

01:26:54:17 - 01:27:12:06
James
And because there's a lot of people who are Republicans who are just going to vote against Trump, but they might not vote against their Republican senator. So it's it's going to it's going to be a terrible night, especially because half of the votes aren't going to be counted that night because they're absentee ballots, I think, or they're early.

01:27:12:09 - 01:28:00:12
James
Yeah, absentee ballots. It's going to be a nightmare. It's going to last for weeks. It's going to be 2000 all over again. Oh, I'm trying to keep up with the chad. I'm doing a terrible job. Yeah. The background checks for guns, things. I don't know how that isn't law. I, I can't it, it truly boggles my mind that, you know, America can sometimes work in such a speedy way to get stuff done.

01:28:02:17 - 01:28:59:02
James
Like after 911, just the incredible amount of security put into airports just like that. And yet how many thousands of people have died of gun violence? And it's just like, yeah, it is. It is the donors. And that's that's that's why I like Bernie Sanders, because he didn't have big donors and stuff. But, you know, take what you can get, I guess if like hopefully Biden wins and we can primary him in 2024 because in Canada it's kind of like we we don't have a A and a version of the Republican Party.

01:28:59:02 - 01:29:29:26
James
We have our conservatives, but they're even called the progressive conservatives because they're their values kind of line up with American Democrats. And then we have the Liberal Party, which is actually a centrist party, and then we have the the New Democratic Party, which is like that's where Bernie Sanders will be and AOC and people like that. Then we've got the Green party, which is further to the left, and then we've got the Socialist Party, which is way to the left.

01:29:29:26 - 01:30:11:09
James
But they never get elected. They never get any seats in Parliament. So yeah, I don't blame you. It does. Gay marriage and queer rights are very much kind of in the US, are are up seem to be up for debate again and it's kind of ridiculous especially with the new Supreme Court nomination that should not be going through at all.

01:30:14:13 - 01:31:33:19
James
I just oh yeah America makes me sad. You Oh Dell, sorry. I've seen you ask if I've read gay New York a couple of times, actually, or just ordered that on Thursday hasn't been delivered yet but I'm reading that for something I'm working on in the future, so I will have read that soon enough. Canada is voting system is annoying because we don't get to vote for our Prime Minister, which really bothers me because if we just vote for our members of Parliament and then whatever party has the most members of Parliament gets to have their prime minister.

01:31:34:05 - 01:31:56:18
James
And so that's it. There's not as many separations as the United States like where you can have Republicans controlling the Congress, Democrats controlling the Senate, and a Republican in the White House. And then everyone kind of has to either get along or work together and nothing gets done. Whereas in Canada, it is very easy for one party to just control everything.

01:31:57:15 - 01:32:40:18
James
And the Conservatives did that for something like 12 years, 11 or 12 years before the current before Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister and Canada was doing not great during that time. No, we don't have a House of Lords, but we have a Senate and they're the unelected friends of the politicians who I do watch the crown. I love the crown.

01:32:40:18 - 01:33:13:06
James
I'm not sure who's playing Margaret Thatcher. Everything I've seen about the next season, it's all about how Diana is going to be included, which is kind of obvious. Yeah, that's going to be interesting. I wonder how they're going to portray Thatcher. Like if they're going to be nice. Oh, my God. Gillian Anderson Oh, that's fantastic. I hope they portray her the right way.

01:33:16:14 - 01:34:12:11
James
Like do not make her look like a decent person. Hey, Laurel. Yeah, I. Laura, I just answered. I answered all the questions, Patron. And yes, this video will be up on the channel for anyone to rewatch. And it it'll be up for, for everyone, which I was planning on just doing this for an hour, but we're an hour and a half now, so countries that are very LGBTQ friendly, the Netherlands, the Netherlands is very good and most people speak English there.

01:34:12:14 - 01:34:59:13
James
The vast majority of them. I would love to visit the Netherlands. That's another place I'd like to go. Yeah. I've never met an English person who has a nice thing to say about Margaret Thatcher. It's the same way in around the time of Thatcher and Reagan. Canada had Mulrooney as our Prime Minister. And I've never met a Canadian who has a nice thing to about Mulroney.

01:34:59:21 - 01:35:41:09
James
But so many Americans love Ronald Reagan. And I'm like, We've all realized that our eighties leaders were backward and dumb. Why haven't you? I did see North See Texas. Yeah, I saw that a while ago. It's really good. And I mean, at least with Reagan, like, I've watched his campaign commercials and stuff and I've seen him like, do speeches, and it's like, okay, I get why people like him.

01:35:41:09 - 01:36:22:22
James
I get it. I cannot wrap my head around what people saw in Margaret Thatcher and Mulroney. I can't at all pay, you know, just because Reagan seemed nice at the time. You can you can have you can look at history and see that he's not great. Norman. That's when I lost. I used to love Hillary Clinton. And when she was talking about how Nancy Reagan was like this epitome of human rights, that's when I was like, Oh, okay, I'm not I'm not a fan of of Hillary anymore because Nancy was not going to say it.

01:36:24:27 - 01:37:51:26
James
But I'm sure you know what I was about to say. I don't know why people feel nostalgic for the eighties, to be honest. It's like I've never understood that there is nothing happening in the eighties that was particularly amazing. Eighties music. Yeah, I love eighties music and some movies from the eighties are really good. But I mean, I feel like that's not I know last decade before the internet took off.

01:37:51:26 - 01:38:27:27
James
Yeah I hadn't thought of that That's that's before the world realized how terrible everything was. Steven That sucks I have other than on Twitter, I have not met a single person who is like, Yeah, Trump. And there are people in my family who are relatively conservative. And even in 2016 they looked at him and they were like, What the hell are they doing?

01:38:39:08 - 01:39:26:23
James
Yes, the UK is doing wonderful right now. Oh my God, No, no. The movies are not that good. Not good enough for that. No, you're right. So I'm so lucky I lucked into having a boss that. Well, my boss is super, super progressive and the CEO is. She seems very. If you've watched House of Cards, she's like Claire Underwood.

01:39:26:28 - 01:40:17:02
James
You kind of get that vibe from her, but she's actually kind of awesome. Yeah, Laura, I know. There's I know there's there are Trump supporters here. I saw a poll where it was like, I think Alberta is the only province that the majority of people support. Trump or close to the majority, but they are everywhere. I did see a Trump bumper sticker and I'm like, Why do you have a Trump bumper sticker?

01:40:18:01 - 01:41:05:28
James
What You can't vote for him. Why are you or why are you risking getting your truck keyed? I don't know how gay conservatives exist like the Gays for Trump movement, which was hilarious because there was like three of them and they were interesting. My only like, thought process on how gays can support Trump are they're rich enough to not have to worry about their rights taken away.

01:41:06:18 - 01:41:44:29
James
But then there's like gays who make like minimum wage. We're like, yay, Trump. I mean, that's like, okay, you're you're you're racist. Just say it. You're racist. It's fine. I mean, it's not fine, but if you admit it, then, you know, if you admit you have a problem, maybe someone can help you. Oh, my God. He did hold it up upside.

01:41:50:03 - 01:42:23:02
James
I feel like Trump has been president for 20 years. Honest to God, he's done so much stupid shit in four years. It's not even four years like. Yeah, I see people online who are on Twitter who are like, I support Trump and I'm sorry for the Southern accent. I know Southern people and they don't like Trump, but they're like, I support Trump.

01:42:23:08 - 01:43:33:07
James
And then in their like Twitter profile, it's like fight for universal health care and stuff. My how do those two things coexist in your brain? Every month is being generous. I'd say it's every week like remember he was impeached this year. Yeah yeah, impeached, but not convicted because the Senate had to do that. And Republicans don't have a backbone that's really holding out hope for for that.

01:43:33:07 - 01:43:58:03
James
But but then we would have ended up with Mike Pence as president and then people wouldn't be. I feel like the race would be a lot closer if it was actually Mike Pence, especially Mike Pence versus Joe Biden. They're basically the same person ones just more religious and weird than the other. So I could see that being a very close race.

01:43:58:03 - 01:44:41:24
James
So it's probably better that he didn't get kicked out. Impulse will be out in early November before I watch that live and when the fly fell on his head, I just laughed uproariously because Mike Pence is so religious and flies being attracted to you in the Bible means that you are in league with the devil. And it just made laugh so hard.

01:44:49:11 - 01:45:27:16
James
Like I don't know if flies poop. I'm sure they do. I, I hope it pooped on him and just Kamala Harris looking at him and seeing the fly. It's like she could see the fly. And she was not telling him. Oh, good. I hope it threw up on him. Yeah, I feel like the devil is not that bad.

01:45:28:16 - 01:46:15:28
James
Like when you actually, like, read the Bible and stuff, it's like, I don't know. Lucifer doesn't seem that bad. Not as bad as some of the people we have on Earth. So I love when conservative politicians cry a Well, I mean, you know, I don't know about the devil, but I know the church of Satan is like pretty progressive.

01:46:16:10 - 01:46:59:22
James
So I would rather a Satanist get elected than an evangelical Christian feel like we'd a lot better off. Oh, my God. A mug that says conservative tears. I need that. So the Church of Satan is good, but the Satanic temple is very litigious and annoying. Church st is cool though I have not seen a very English scandal, but I really want to because.

01:47:00:07 - 01:48:02:25
James
Oh, I can't remember his name. The Star Q in in seven? Yes. Yes. He he is one of my celebrity crushes. So like that's been on my to watch list for a long time. No London spy. I haven't seen that either. That's also on there. I need I need to actually make a list like put it on my whiteboard and start kind of going through these things and need to take a break from making videos and and take a break from work just to watch TV for a month because I took a month off of work at the end of summer to work on the the porn video, which initially had like interviews and stuff.

01:48:02:25 - 01:48:51:12
James
It was so much more we should definitely start Satan schools. Yes make sure they're tax exempt and teach the laws of the Church of Satan, which are basically like be nice to people, don't be a dick. My Halloween plans probably just sitting on the couch watching. Netflix since I've never been big on Halloween. Even as a kid, I didn't like going trick or treating because I was that weird kid.

01:48:51:21 - 01:49:22:16
James
I loved dressing up, but I hated actually going trick or treating. And so since I've been like 13 or 14, Halloween has always just been invite friends over and watch horror movies. But since I can't really invite anyone over because of the Corona, then I will just watch horror movies and horror TV shows by myself. Oh, God, Morgan, That sucks.

01:49:24:20 - 01:50:21:16
James
Oh, maybe I can set up like a watch, Rocky Horror watch A lot of is is the craft remake or remake or is it a sequel? I didn't even watch the Trailer because I was I had just watched the movie and I saw the screencap and I was like, This doesn't look good. I can't tell if it's a sequel or a remake.

01:50:24:03 - 01:51:35:04
James
Oh, thank you. Bueller, Boy, I think that's how you say that. Thank you very much. Like, I just watched the craft for the first time not long ago for the deep cuts because I hadn't seen it growing up. And where you got to mess with that, it's perfect the way it is. Like the only thing if you're going to remake it, just make the lesbianism more overt or just bring back the the the original cast because, you know, it's not like Neve Campbell is not still amazing lesbian happy ending.

01:51:35:04 - 01:52:55:08
James
Imagine that. That would be interesting. Nice to see. Oh thank you. Darkroom. You guys are awesome. Thank you. Darkroom more Marcia Brady. Are you excited to see any films that were supposed to be released this year? I was so excited for Dune like. And now it's been delayed until next year, next December. I think because I, like every gay in the world, has a crush on Timothee Chalamet and getting in in a movie, that would actually be fun to watch because I, unlike every other gay, did not like the The Peach movie The Call Me by your name.

01:53:04:18 - 01:53:31:01
James
And I was excited for that. I was excited for the Eternals, Wonder Woman. They've all been delayed except for Wonder Woman, which is supposedly coming out on Christmas Day in theaters. But I think at the last minute, Warner Brothers might announce that it's going to go to theaters and VOD at the same time because they're not going to make any money if they put that in theaters.

01:53:36:07 - 01:54:20:28
James
What are your thoughts on the MCU as it currently stands? I think the coronavirus is the best thing that happened to the MCU because there is basically going to be a two year gap between Spider-Man slash endgame and the next Marvel movie. And I think that big gap is going to make people excited for it again, because I feel like Endgame was such a huge ending that following it up with another movie, you know, a year later would have been like, okay, just it's just more Marvel.

01:54:21:07 - 01:54:48:01
James
But I feel like actually giving people this break is going to make people excited for them again. I don't know if Black Widow is the perfect movie to follow it up because Black Widow just seems like a sort of a female James Bond movie, which I'm totally fine. I mean, if if as long as it comes out when it's not risking your life, you go to the movie theaters, I will definitely go see it.

01:54:48:27 - 01:55:22:24
James
But I mean, the thing with Marvel that I'm most looking forward to is Wandavision, and partially because I love Scarlet Witch and I think she's amazing, an amazing character, and also because it is hopefully going to be setting up Wicked, which will set up working in Lang, which is my kind of ship forever. I think Spider-Man far from Home was okay because Spider-Man is kind of disconnected.

01:55:26:03 - 01:55:58:29
James
And I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job. And honestly, anything that Tom Holland's in, I'm like, Yeah, that's a good movie. It could be terrible, but Tom Holland's in it, so I'm going to see it as being awesome. I think Wandavision is going to be about Wanda. Here's my thesis of what Wandavision is going to be about.

01:55:59:05 - 01:56:17:25
James
Wanda is in kind of captivity because she's too powerful, so she's had to be locked away. And so she's in this sort of mind prison, which is, you know, the old TV shows and stuff, and she's going to create her babies. She's going to have this amazing that she's very happy about, and then it's all going to get snapped out of reality.

01:56:18:04 - 01:56:57:28
James
And I think that at the end, she is going to rip open reality and that is going to lead to the Spider-Man sequel, which we know has multiverse stuff that's going to lead to Doctor Strange. I think she is basically going to rip open reality at the end of Wandavision and that's going to set up the entirety of Phase four of Marvel, basically leading to an Avengers movie where she is the villain because I think that's the only way to go forward right now because Thanos was such a big villain that you can't just go, okay, well, we're going to do Galactus now because, you know, we're just going to make the villains get bigger

01:56:57:28 - 01:57:19:29
James
and stronger. You need to have a villain that the karoq the other Avengers care about, and I think that's the best way to do it. And then they wouldn't kill her. She would get kind of locked away. And then, you know, young Avengers happens, blah, blah, blah, and then children's Crusade and I have all of this worked out so that young Avengers can happen.

01:57:19:29 - 01:57:51:11
James
So I might be a bit biased. I am so pissed off that glow got canceled. Glow is such a fantastic show. Like Netflix needs to stop doing dumb stuff like that. I mean, the cast is arguing for a movie to finish it off. Make no give them that final season. If it's a year late, it's a year late.

01:57:51:12 - 01:59:18:20
James
Like just give them the final season. You can't wrap up a cast that huge with a two hour movie. I get very passionate about my Netflix shows. I read about that, that that mayor tried to ban end game for the for the the gay character and I'm like who do you think you are Russia and China couldn't even get Disney to let them remove that you think going to really why is my room blue half of it's blue and half of it is gray.

01:59:22:13 - 01:59:46:09
James
I've lived in this apartment for four years and it had beige walls and I got really bored during the initial months of COVID 19 and I was like, I'm going to paint. And my wall accidentally ended up being blue screen color, which makes it really easy to do. I've been experimenting with stuff like that, but I'm made for my videos.

01:59:46:09 - 02:00:47:18
James
But my videos are also so damn depressing and dour that having like a fun green screen background would be fun. Blue screen background be kind of off putting. I feel like it's like people are dying, people are being murdered and look, I'm in somewhere I'm not so do they. Oh my God, I love that. Mike, After self-isolating for seven months.

02:00:48:05 - 02:01:35:10
James
Yes, Mr. No, before. I don't know. I'm very sad about that. I grew up with cats and I really want to get a pit bull, but my building doesn't allow dogs, so I'm hoping to move soon either into a building that does or into a house so that I can get a pit bull puppy. My hair is technically blond ish when I actually go out in the sun long enough, it is like light blond, but I'm never out in the sun, which is why I'm so damn white.

02:01:37:24 - 02:02:21:28
James
So it's kind of strawberry blond, picks up red tones really easily and I'm like, Quarantine would have been the perfect time to get a puppy because I was home for six months, I think, before my office reopened, right? Yeah, I think it's a ginger in denial. I do have like half I'm half Irish, I'm half Irish and half Russian, which is why my head is so round.

02:02:24:10 - 02:03:20:14
James
So I don't think I could say I'm a ginger though, because I have no freckles. I did as a kid, but they all went away. Yeah. Other corn, other countries have had their quarantines and candidate. Well not all of Canada. My is is done. We have zero cases right now, although it seems to be going up. So my my bosses kind of told us all like take your computers home every night, which it's my computer that I use anyway because I refuse to use a PC, take your computers home every night because we may be telling you to work from home going forward at any moment.

02:03:20:14 - 02:04:27:18
James
So, no, my, my, my hair goes from like dark blond to red, depending upon the color of the lights around me. Right now, it looks more blondish brown. I think that's because I have a very white light. But if I had a yellow light on me, it would be more reddish. That doesn't sound like you hate gingers. I have a I have I have a a a huge I love gingers so I would be happy to embrace any ginger.

02:04:33:03 - 02:05:19:14
James
Yeah. Oh, March 16th. That's the date. That was the last day I was in my office to. No, it was earlier than that because I had a throat infection that I later found out was COVID and turned into the full thing. Cameron Monahan is the perfect person, man. Just who I have had a crush on him since I watched the firsts for like eight years now, since I first started watching Shameless and what changed in my life since Corona Virus?

02:05:21:16 - 02:05:57:16
James
Well, people started watching my YouTube channel, which was a pretty big change. I had 300 subscribers four months ago and now I've got 30,000. So that's a pretty big jump. Other than that, my life hasn't changed all that much, but I don't have to pay as much for gas to drive to work. So that's that was good. I have more money, I guess.

02:06:14:14 - 02:06:39:06
James
Yeah. Evil queens. A lot of people kind of found me for that because a lot of people monsters in the closet got pushed by YouTube during Pride Month and that's where people kind of found me. But I didn't get a lot of subscribers out of it. I got a lot of subscribers from the history of gay baiting and the the Disney and Evil Queens.

That's where most of my subscribers came from. But I make an Instagram for my YouTube channel. I, I don't know if I would make one specifically for the channel. I have an Instagram account, but I, I see a lot of people who they make like Twitters and Instagrams and stuff specifically for their YouTube channels and for privacy and stuff like that.

02:07:16:28 - 02:08:44:21
James
And I'm I've never been a very private person, so I'm just like, Hey, if you like my YouTube stuff, follow me wherever. And I post about stuff. Oh, I'm sorry, but hey, young Sebastian. Stan So it's not all bad. It's funny how Monsters in the Closet got recommended because it was originally three different videos. That's why if you watch it, my I changed clothes in it because it was it's it's broken up into three parts in the hour long video now but it was three separate videos at one time and I put them all together because it was just some people were asking that it would be easier to watch it that way.

02:08:45:11 - 02:10:10:04
James
And that's why on my YouTube like video history, it looks like that came out after the Harry Potter video. But the Harry Potter video came out after Monsters in the Closet. Who is Andy? Signora? I am not sure who he is. Ooh, I did not know that. Oh, lovely. Let's open up the Twitters and get rid of that.

02:10:29:24 - 02:11:28:17
James
Oh, yeah, I had no idea. Thank you for pointing that out. I'm usually pretty good with kind of screening. Who I retweet stuff from, mostly because I don't want to accidentally retweet a turf gang. I tweet a lot. Okay. I'm going to have to hunt that down. My favorite LGBT movie. Um, Hedwig and the Angry Inch. That was the first kind of gay movie I saw when I was young.

02:11:29:08 - 02:11:47:11
James
I lived 40 minutes away from the nearest blockbuster, and they were the only people who had the movie. And I would go there every Friday and rent it for the weekend and just watch it over and over and watch the documentary on the DVD and the audio commentary. And I can basically recite it when I'm watching the movie.

02:11:47:11 - 02:12:44:13
James
Now, I oh my God, I'm jealous. I need to see. I've never even seen a play before. I, I, I need a life. My favorite gay love story. Um, I mentioned Achilles and Patrick. Cliff's earlier, so I'd probably say that song of Achilles is where it's most obviously a gay love story, but in the myth, it's it's there.

02:13:08:18 - 02:13:47:20
James
Oh, David and Patrick. Yes, I love David and Patrick because it was the rare occasion where it's not two models who are the gay characters. So I felt like, Oh, this is actually possible to go in. Harry Scorpius and Albus. Nobody can tell me that's not a gay love story. Oh, Achilles was a total bottom power bottom, but he was a bottom.

02:13:56:29 - 02:14:28:22
James
I saw boned when I was nine years old. My mother rented it and I was in the living room while she was watching it. I bit young. Newest kid in the royal family. Would that be William's kid? So I've seen that. I've seen people talk about like, Oh, he's so feminine. Oh, he's, you know, he might be gay.

02:14:28:27 - 02:15:10:26
James
I'm like, Well, he might be, but he's a he's a little kid. And if he is the royal family going to have to deal with that, like they're going to you know, he's in succession for the throne. He's in the line of succession. So they're going to have to not be assholes about that. I watched Boys Don't Cry when I was a kid and I was so confused because I didn't get the idea of a transgender person and I didn't pick it up from the movie.

02:15:11:05 - 02:15:47:26
James
So I had no idea what was going on. I haven't seen Torchwood, I'm told I need to. I want I, I've gotten through two episodes of Doctor Who. And so I was like, Oh, I'm probably not going to be able to get through Torchwood, but I'm told that it's different. Red, White and Royal Blue is fantastic. That's one of my favorite books this year.

02:16:13:18 - 02:17:33:07
James
American Gods. The book must be the TV show. I don't any I don't remember a gay story from the book. I mean, who needs an excuse to stare at him? Really? Oh, Charles, that's a that's a resounding endorsement. Oh, that's really cool. I watched Lost in Delirious an odd amount of times when I was a kid. Little no kid when I was a teenager.

02:17:33:14 - 02:19:13:04
James
And I read the book. It's based on as well. The book is a bit darker than the movie, though. My best friend at the time was bisexual and she was absolutely in love with Piper Perabo. Perabo, I think that's her last name. Rocket Man is infinitely better than Bohemian Rhapsody. Bohemian Rhapsody is just a generic musician story, which is sad because Freddie Mercury was not a generic musician, and nor did he have a generic musician story.

02:19:13:22 - 02:19:59:19
James
It had it was just so blah. It was it was a one performance movie. The only reason anyone cared about that movie was because of Rami Malek. And I really think Rocketman would have gotten a lot more attention from. The general population and like the critics and the academy and stuff, had it not come out the year after Bohemian Rhapsody because it was a way better movie, not just Better is in Story, but Taron Egerton did an amazing job.

02:20:00:00 - 02:21:01:11
James
He actually sang, whereas Rami Malek didn't. And even though it had the same director, he did so much more creative things with Rocketman. Oh, well, thank you for coming, Morgan Yeah, yeah. Bryan Singer was directing it, and then he had a meltdown and he was replaced. So I don't blame the director for Bohemian Rhapsody. I blame Bryan Singer for that, but I blame Bryan Singer for a lot of things.

02:21:14:21 - 02:21:41:07
James
Yes, they are. They are making a David Bowie biopic. But his son isn't letting them use any of the music because they're I forget the reason, but it's they're not they're not being entirely faithful. So at some point, David Bowie biopic will be made. The David Bowie biopic will be made with proper music, and I think his son should direct it.

02:21:41:07 - 02:23:11:19
James
His son's is actually a fantastic director. Jones He directed the movie. Moon Yeah, Well, thank you for coming by. I actually think I should probably wrap this up soon. That's after 10:00 here. Autumn I would love that. It would be a great excuse to go to the UK. That is the perfect description of Bohemian Rhapsody, a gay movie for straight people in Mamma mia is a straight movie for gay people.

02:23:25:05 - 02:24:27:10
James
One thing behind me, my bed, my baby, Yoda. Oh, wow. Thank you. Dark row. Sleep well. You are awesome. And think how long. Okay, we will go for another 5 minutes and 50, 40, another another 5 minutes. That'll bring this up to two and a half hours. And which is longer than I thought it was going to be.

02:24:32:07 - 02:25:07:21
James
I think I might like, I don't know if monthly is too often, but do this more often. It's fun getting to actually talk everyone instead of trying to keep up with comments and stuff because I suck at that. I am very excited to have some German subscribers just adding to my excuses to visit Germany. Hannah That would be a good idea actually.

02:25:07:21 - 02:25:48:19
James
Yeah. I think philosophy YouTube does that give me more content because I've now got usually a 90 minute at least an hour long video a month and now the podcast comes out weekly and I can do one of these for each of the full length videos that come out and becoming a tiny little media empire. Thank you, Laura.

02:25:48:19 - 02:26:22:12
James
It has like I am, I am regularly shocked at how awesome everyone who watches my videos are. There is so few comments that are in any way negative. There might be like some people pointing out like a factual mistake here or there, but like very rarely is there any like real negativity on my I think I'm at that kind of sweet spot where I have enough reach that there's lots of people enjoying the videos, but there's not enough that.

02:26:22:12 - 02:27:05:25
James
It's, you know, you're in the control points territory where there's people just hate watching you. Well, thank you, John. I feel like my last couple have been less entertaining and more informative. So and my next one is definitely maybe not entertaining, but I'm definitely going for that for for December. I've actually never used Discord before. I have no idea what works.

02:27:18:03 - 02:28:02:22
James
Isobel I'm in a war, not with YouTube right now, but over one of my videos in a complete war. That is very frustrating. So yes, I wish the YouTube system wasn't a dick. Any good movies with a trans male main character. You know, it's bad. I can't think of any. Well, the all the queer movies I've been watching, I can't think of any.

02:28:04:25 - 02:29:15:09
James
There's a few good books coming out with trans male characters, but I can't think of any movies, at least none that don't end with sadness. Yeah, Dragon Age Inquisition is one of the one of the games I'm going to cover in my gay gaming video. Queer gaming video. When I get to it. Hades is another one I've been playing.

02:29:15:11 - 02:29:59:13
James
If you play video games, check out Hades. It's it's on PC and switch right now. It's really fun. Like hack and slash gaming and there is a gay relationship option that it's not even it's not even coding and there's so much shipping going on right now online It's a it's amazing and it's not coded and it's not so it's like straight people are actually seeing it in the game and they're like, oh yeah, Hades is third person isometric.

02:29:59:13 - 02:30:33:12
James
So it's like high up. You can see the whole stage, so you should be good for that that. Oh no, do it, do it. Mike It's worth it. Okay, We're at the two hour and 30 minute mark. I will wrap it up here. Thank you, guys so much. This has been so much fun. I was worried that it was going to be like slow and we weren't going to have enough to talk about and that did not happen.

02:30:33:12 - 02:30:57:00
James
And you guys are fantastic. So thank you so much for coming by. I like the idea of doing one of these after each of the big videos, so I think that's what I'm going to do. So yeah, I hope you guys have a great night. Have a great weekend. And you know, I'm on Twitter constantly, so if you have any other or anything like that, just shoot them to me and I'll be happy to answer them.

02:30:57:11 - 02:31:02:12
James
So have a great night, guys. I will see you again soon. Bye.

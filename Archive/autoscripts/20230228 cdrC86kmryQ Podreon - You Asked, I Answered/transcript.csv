"James","00:00:00:08","00:00:29:11","Hello, everyone, and welcome to the latest episode of the Podrian. I am James Solo once again. I'm just going to go forward, just Nick will be special appearances on the pod for Ron and I will just figure out something to talk about every week. So how's everyone doing? This isn't a livestream, so this that question just doesn't really make sense, does it?"
"James","00:00:29:12","00:01:07:03","Asking the crowd, but leave it in the comments below or on this post how you're doing. Because I actually do care about how you're all doing. Um, so I put out, um, having estimated that Nick would not be here for this podcast, I put out a question on the Patron, um, Discord server asking, you know, like we used to do AGMs every month with patrons where, you know, everyone could ask any questions at all that they wanted."
"James","00:01:07:03","00:01:40:17","And then I would do a live stream answering the questions and then, you know, other people would come on and I would answer their questions and stuff like that, and patrons would have their their questions would obviously take precedent. But I've been doing so many livestreams now that I feel like doing an old school AMA is kind of, um, not really useful, I guess, because, you know, I'm answering everyone's questions like every second night on YouTube."
"James","00:01:41:15","00:02:01:02","And so it's like, why, why do a normal AMA? But I thought, you know what I would like to actually keep doing AMA is that ah, patron exclusive. And so maybe instead of doing streams we can do these podcasts and if you guys would prefer it to be a stream, by all means, you are my boss after all."
"James","00:02:01:19","00:02:27:17","And um, so yeah, I've got a couple of questions here. Not a whole ton, so I don't think the podcast will be super duper long, but God knows I can go on rambling incessantly for ever. I mean, the last 2 minutes was me just explaining that I'm going to answer some questions that you asked so God knows I can go forever and ever if I have a topic to go on."
"James","00:02:28:13","00:02:57:15","So. So the first question is what is the most conservative piece of media that you know, which has a very popular queer reading? And this one kind of caught me off guard because I really had to think about it because I was like, Do I watch any queer media or do I do? Yes. Do I watch any conservative media at all, like, ever?"
"James","00:02:58:05","00:03:25:01","And I really had to think about it. And my brain, once I started kind of ruminating on it, my brain went to attack on Titan, which is, you know, has kind of been co-opted by conservatives, not so much conservatives as like the far right. It's been co-opted by the far right, whereas there's a lot of queer readings and just queer representation in Attack on Titan."
"James","00:03:25:01","00:03:59:11","So that was the first thing that my brain went to. But kind of like going through my movie collections and all the TV shows that I've watched, I really started to like really think like, what have I watched that could be considered conservative? Um, and honestly, the, the closest thing to conservative media that I can say that I've watched is Lord of the Rings."
"James","00:04:01:04","00:04:44:04","And let me just explain why, for the most part in Lord of the Rings, it is very conservative, but it's not conservative in a in most cases anyway, in a negative kind of, um, sort of not retroactive, but kind of going back in time, kind of regressive. It's not it's not conservative in a in a regressive way, but just sort of looking at the past with, um, you know, a fondness Tolkien was very, very fond of, um, you know, pastoral ness growing up in the countryside."
"James","00:04:44:12","00:05:17:17","And he called it urban creep when he watched the city as as England would during the Industrial Revolution, as England industrialized more and more. And he he watched as a child and a teenager as the factories would move closer and closer to, you know, his small little, you know, pastoral village that he was growing up in. And I'd you know, he would watch the smokestacks get closer every year."
"James","00:05:19:07","00:05:44:07","And I think that's a that's a traditionally conservative thought process. Um, you know that the city is bad and small towns are good. That's a very traditional conservative thought process, something that a lot of conservative politicians have kind of latched on to recently to kind of say, Oh, all those crazies in New York City, in Los Angeles, they try and run the country."
"James","00:05:44:07","00:06:03:02","And it's you know, it's the small towns that are the the life bread of the life, the life bread, the lifeblood of the country and stuff like that. Um, and, you know, that's very much what Tolkien was saying, but he wasn't saying the people who live in the city are evil. He was or bad or backwards or anything like that."
"James","00:06:03:02","00:06:35:11","He was more so saying that, you know, the encroachment on nature was bad, that, you know, there's nothing wrong with cities. It's when cities start taking over more than kind of their initial footprint. And of course, there's, you know, very few there are very powerful women in the Lord of the Rings, but very few of them kind of step outside the traditional, um, magical woman role that has existed for millennia at this point."
"James","00:06:35:22","00:07:02:21","You know, women in fantasy, going back to mythology were always, you know, sort of seers or, you know, they had powers that were magical and, you know, kind of keeping with keeping women in the home, not sending them out to work kind of mindset. Um, but you do have a twin who does, you know, go out and battle and she does defeat the Witch King and all of that."
"James","00:07:02:21","00:07:35:07","So I do think that and also the, the, the Brotherhood thing is very, you know, men being men kind of thing. But Tolkien and this is actually came a lot from the generation that did fight in World War One is that there was a sort of a softness, um, not that they were weak or anything like that, but they were willing to admit when they needed help a bit more."
"James","00:07:35:20","00:08:05:20","Then the generations that came after them, because they went through the war and they saw these traumatic things and they were willing to admit that they lost you know, men were willing to say that they lost people they loved, meaning their friends. And, you know, there's obviously a very queer reading of that where, you know, a man saying, I loved this person and they're gone now and they're speaking about another man."
"James","00:08:05:20","00:08:43:13","Can obviously be read as, you know, either bisexuality or repressed homosexuality and something like that. But that's really something that for the generations after World War One, you didn't really hear men say that they loved other men. Um, so like I said, it's conservative in a non regressive way. The Lord of the Rings. And it's conservative in a way that people who live in the red states and people who live in the blue states can both watch or read it and enjoy it because it's not regressive."
"James","00:08:44:19","00:09:05:02","Um, well, with race stuff it can be kind of regressive, but not super bad. Um, and you're probably saying The Lord of the Rings is not a conservative piece of media. What is he going on about? And I just kind of it shows you how little conservative media I've watched, I've been I've been recommended Yellowstone by a bunch of people."
"James","00:09:05:12","00:09:28:00","Um, and they're like, Oh, this is fantastic. This is like a callback to eighties soap operas, primetime soap operas like Dallas and stuff like that. And then other people I watch are like, Oh, this is like the Republican's favorite show. And then the showrunner is like, I really don't want it to be their favorite show. And so it's like very torn."
"James","00:09:28:00","00:09:55:15","But, um, yeah, the piece of media that I have watched or taken in that could be argued to be conservative of that I that also can have a queer reading because I mean you look at, you look at Mary and Pippin and it's like, oh, they boyfriends, you look at Frodo and Sam, and I think it's very personally, I kind of look at them as, um, that there is a love, a love relationship between Frodo and Sam."
"James","00:09:55:15","00:10:26:21","But Frodo is asexual, but not necessarily a romantic. And you know, Frodo goes off to the, um, the undying lands with the elves and Gandalf at the end of Lord of the Rings. And Sam goes back to the shire with his wife and his children. But once his wife has passed on, he goes to the undying lands to be with Frodo for all eternity and I think that that's more than just a strong male friendship."
"James","00:10:27:13","00:10:45:21","You know, if you're choosing to be with, you know, you're, you're dude for all of eternity. And so yeah, I think Lord of the Rings would be that probably not quite the answer that you were expecting, because a lot of people kind of think Lord of the Rings is even before Rings of Power. People thought Lord of the Rings was woke."
"James","00:10:46:08","00:11:15:03","Um, and, but yeah, that's, I haven't watched a whole lot of conservative media, so that's as good as I can go. Um, the next question is a much more simpler one, I think. What kind of transportation do y'all have? Cars, bikes, etc. and do you have any specific feeling about them? Um, I because of the brain injury I sustained when I was living."
"James","00:11:16:05","00:11:17:09","Yes, when I was 11."
"Speaker 2","00:11:17:19","00:11:18:09","Um."
"James","00:11:18:21","00:11:39:10","When I came out of the closet and somebody found out and they were not happy with that and they knocked me off the back of the head with a rock due to that, I have very poor balance. So bicycle skateboards, roller skates, normal ice skates. They had never been able to do it. Um, I do have a car."
"James","00:11:39:11","00:12:03:20","I have, um. I have a very fancy, very expensive car. A Hyundai. Alondra It's blue, and its name is Billy, and I do love it. I've had it for, uh, since before the pandemic. The summer before the pandemic. So the summer of 2019. So I've had it for going on three, four years now. And I've never had a single problem with that car."
"James","00:12:04:07","00:12:24:01","Um, knock on wood, this desk seems like it's wood. Um, I've never had a problem with it. Great gas mileage has, like, all the stuff. It's a it's a it's a great car. I really love it. Um, it's the newest car I've ever. I've ever driven."
"Speaker 2","00:12:24:17","00:12:25:10","Um."
"James","00:12:26:11","00:12:46:13","And that was a priority for me when I got a job that was paying me enough that I could cover rent and food and hobbies and a car that was like a big deal for me. So I immediately went out and got a car, um, because I grew up around cars. My dad was a mechanic. Um, there are a lot of people in my family were mechanics."
"James","00:12:46:13","00:13:08:07","My dad's a mechanic. A lot of my uncles are mechanics, especially on my dad's side, the Somerton side. There's a lot of mechanics over there, whereas on my mom's side, it's a lot of carpenters. Um, and so I'm actually good with cars and I can, like, build furniture and stuff. So, um, secretly have some street aspects to me as well."
"James","00:13:08:20","00:13:30:00","Um, but yeah, so I have a car that's the only piece of transportation I have. I'm not great with public transportation, with busses and stuff like that. I get really anxious on them. Um, and it's not the bus or the train or anything like that that makes me anxious. It's because I'm epileptic and have anxiety disorder. I feel panicky sometimes."
"James","00:13:30:07","00:13:46:10","I feel like I'm going to have a seizure and I don't panic as much when I have the control of being able to be like, okay, I'm going to jump in my car and get home as soon as possible because I know there's not actually going to be a seizure. I know it's anxiety. That's why I'm still allowed to have a license."
"James","00:13:47:01","00:14:06:02","Um, but, you know, if there's this detachment or I'm relying on trains to arrive on time or busses to arrive on time, or what if I miss the bus? Or what if it's really stressful? What if, you know, I'm accosted by a stranger or something like that? I get really stressed out by that. So that's why that's why I like I like having a car."
"James","00:14:06:07","00:14:32:19","Um, even though where I live, I am next door to a mall and there's a like a little bodega style grocery store, like right across the street. It's wonderful that I probably could get away with not having a car at all, but movies are going into production soon, so it's good to have a car. Um, next question. If you could live in any fictional universe, which would it be and why?"
"James","00:14:33:04","00:14:55:09","Bonus round What would you do with your time there? Uh, if I could live in any fictional universe, That's a really good question. Um, yeah. I hate the fact that my brain immediately goes to Hogwarts. Um, but I actually don't think I would enjoy living at Hogwarts. I think. I think I would. I would have problems with that."
"James","00:14:55:20","00:15:41:13","Um, I think any fictional universe I would, I might say so Star Wars, um, I've been falling off a bit with Star Wars. I haven't been as big a fan of the last couple of years, but just sort of super future stick. Um, like mythologically super or mythologically futuristic just really seems appealing to me. Um, and so, yeah, I think, I think it would probably be Star Wars because, you know, you've got all of this crazy advanced medical technology and you've got all of this, you know, hopefully it would be in a time where the Empire wasn't ruling the galaxy."
"James","00:15:42:00","00:16:16:14","Um, my luck. I would be like, born the year that Palpatine took power or something like that. But I think Star Wars would probably be the one and what would I do with my time there? I would probably travel, you know, since sort of faster than light travel is possible in that universe. I would travel around and see different planets and stuff like that, because if you've seen any live streams or anything like that, you know that I've never traveled in my life, I've never gone on a vacation or anything like that."
"James","00:16:16:14","00:16:48:10","So the idea of being able to hop on a ship and go to a whole other planet just sounds amazing to me. So, yeah, I would think that Star Wars would be, um, the next question Do you have anybody real or fictional you would call your role models and why? Um, I don't have any real role models. I've never really had any, uh, except for one Joanne Rowling."
"James","00:16:48:10","00:17:24:00","And we know how that turned out. I don't have a whole lot of, like, film making role models either, because most of the directors that I think are amazing artists are kind of shitty people, so. But, um, fictional role models and I know even this is problematic. Uh, growing up I was like, if I can't be a director, I want to be Brian Kinney, the lead character from the American version of Queer as Folk, because Brian Kinney was very assertive."
"James","00:17:24:15","00:17:46:23","He if horrible stuff happened, he moved past it. And, um, you know, kind of made the best of it. The thing that pops up in my mind the most is when he was fired from I think I think he was fired. He was fired from the advertising agency that he was very close to becoming a partner at."
"Speaker 2","00:17:47:12","00:17:48:02","Um."
"James","00:17:48:14","00:18:16:15","And instead of just wallowing, he started his own advertising agency and poached their clients. And that's the kind of thing that I, I like to think that I can do that, you know, when there's when bad stuff happens, when, you know, the, for instance, with the YouTube channel, when stuff really slows down and the views drop and the ad sense drops and we lose patrons and stuff like that, I, I don't lie."
"James","00:18:16:15","00:18:40:13","I panic a little bit. And then I kind of sit down and figure out, how can I reverse this? What can I do to reverse this? And sometimes there's nothing you can do because the algorithm is the algorithm, but sometimes it's something like, I'm going to make a video that I really care about. And usually that involves a very short writing process and probably shooting it within 48 hours."
"James","00:18:42:02","00:19:13:02","That happened with the Dahmer video for, for instance, which is, I think, the best performing video of the year. Um, and that's happening with a couple of other videos as well where there was really fast turnaround. And I find that they end up doing well because I'm kind of very heated, uh, when, when talking about the subjects. And I think audiences really pick up on that, that the audiences can see when you're talking about something because you've kind of been forced into it."
"James","00:19:13:10","00:19:54:09","And when you're talking about something that you actually care about and uh, with the video that I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen, the new round video, it's not out on YouTube yet, but, um, that a lot of you guys have seen that that was one of them that I just was like, I need to write about this because I need to, you know, as a cisgender Harry Potter nerd, you know, someone who very much identified as a Harry Potter fan, especially throughout my teenage years in my twenties, that I have stuff I need to say because my opinion from the confessions of a Harry Potter fan boy video have my my opinions"
"James","00:19:54:09","00:20:20:09","have changed a bit. And I feel like, you know, I don't think that I'm like this world changing thinker or anything like that. But if if I have any trans or non-binary subscribers and they need to see that there is, you know, that there's a person who's willing to at least just give up a video game for them, you know, to do that little bit."
"James","00:20:20:19","00:20:45:12","I feel like that's important. Um, and so I wanted to make that video too, to kind of point that out that, you know, to say to every trans person, especially trans kids, because I know that I have a lot of young trans people who are subscribers on the channel that, you know, there's there is a CIS person who does who does give a damn and who does consider that you're more important than a video game."
"James","00:20:46:05","00:21:07:12","And so I wrote that really fast and I put it out really fast. And the delay going to YouTube is just because I want to start giving you guys, you know, more stuff. I would like to be able to have videos come out for you earlier than like 24 or 48 hours before they get released on YouTube because, you know, I couldn't make these videos without you guys."
"James","00:21:07:12","00:21:33:22","And so I think that, you know, early access isn't that much to ask for. See, I'm rambling. I told you I could drag I could take this over to an hour. Um, what's the next question? Yeah, that one was about. That question was about role models. Um, oof, two questions. Fun question, Favorite type of cake and less fun question."
"James","00:21:34:03","00:21:57:09","How do you deal with prejudice in leftists and other supposedly safe spaces? Um, favorite type of cake? I love chocolate cake with white icing. I'm not allowed to eat cake right now because of my dietary constraints, but if I can get down to £190, I'm allowed to eat cake again. Um, and the first thing I eat when I get to 190 on that scale is going to be a piece of chocolate cake with white icing."
"James","00:21:59:11","00:22:24:15","Um, less fun. Question How do you deal with prejudice in leftist and other supposedly safe spaces? I've been seeing this a lot in my comments from some patrons with the new rolling video kind of not being super happy that I disagree. Not that I disagree with her, but that I do think that maybe we need to let Harry Potter go."
"James","00:22:25:09","00:22:50:06","Um, at least until Universal buys it from her, which I think is I do think is going to happen. Um, I've seen some people be kind of indignant and irate about that, and that makes me sad. And I've seen people on Twitter kind of doing the same thing. And so, like I, I'm lucky enough that, you know, I'm, I'm like, Come at me, come at me."
"James","00:22:50:06","00:23:18:03","I'm I'm a straight passing white gay man like you. You want to you want to come at me, Do it. I will. You know, I will gladly take that on my shoulders if you'll, for God's sake, leave some. Leave some people alone. And usually what I do when I come across them in comments, sections, in Twitter threads and stuff like that, I call them out."
"James","00:23:18:03","00:23:39:22","I, I am not shy about kind of pointing out when someone is a goddamn hypocrite, you know, someone who's like, got AOC plastered, plastered all over their Twitter feed. And they they love these progressive politicians who are all for, you know, raising the minimum wage and higher taxes on the rich and stuff like that, which are all very good and very important."
"James","00:23:39:22","00:24:04:14","I agree with all of that. But then they've got these blinders for certain social justice aspects of it where they're like, you know, people shouldn't have to give up a video game just because someone had multiple people involved in it. You're kind of shitty and, you know, oh, the BLM protests, sometimes they go a bit too far, you know, people like that."
"James","00:24:04:14","00:24:29:05","I'm like, Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, no, no, no. Um, and, you know, my, I just kind of stand up with my white ass and I'm like, my I'm just like, Listen, here's why you're wrong. Because I. I have our being, like I said, a straight passing white cis dude. I have a lot of privilege that comes with that."
"James","00:24:29:13","00:25:03:06","And I think the more privilege you have, the more that's expendable and the more you can put on the line. And so I try and that's what I try and do. I try and, you know, use that kind of extra privilege that I have at my disposal to stand up for people because I think, you know, in any kind of especially queer spaces, leftist queer spaces that suddenly become irate at the idea of, you know, not buying a video game because, you know, the creators were problematic."
"James","00:25:03:12","00:25:27:08","And this isn't just Hogwarts legacy. This has been lots of video games. Stephanie Sterling has talked about this a lot on her channel. And, you know, it's just kind of like, stop being hypocrites, guys, come on. Like we're if we're not all in this together, we're fucked. And so, yeah, I try. I try and just kind of stand up and be the loud mouth because I've always been good at that."
"James","00:25:27:08","00:25:52:23","I've always been good at being the loud. Um, next question. Doo doo doo doo. So sorry if this question isn't applicable. I'm not very active on the server, but I would love to know your opinions on the last of us if you've gotten around to watching it. Specifically the third episode, if it's not of interest to you or it's already been discussed somewhere, please disregard."
"James","00:25:53:14","00:26:16:18","I have talked about it on streams, but not everyone can make it to streams because my stream, you know, I have subscribers and patrons from all over the world, which is amazing. But you know, I'm on the eastern seaboard of North America, so, you know, my time zones do not always line up. And, you know, sometimes those streams goes for hours and hours."
"James","00:26:16:18","00:26:36:23","So I can't, you know, expect people to sit down and watch like an eight hour stream for the 20 minutes that I talk about the Last of us. So, yeah, I have a saying all that I have watched the Last of US. I love it. I watch it every Sunday night. I wanted to wait until it was over to binge it all at once."
"James","00:26:37:06","00:27:05:06","A part of me still wants to wait to binge it, but I'm not going to do that now. At this point, there's only two episodes left and I do absolutely love it. Episode three I have my issues with episode three, mostly in that, you know, the the gay characters are Bill and Frank, I think are their names. I'm pretty I'm pretty sure I'm like 99% sure they are."
"James","00:27:05:13","00:27:27:20","They're important to Joel's development, but it's not that difficult to just read a synopsis of what happens to Joel and Ellie in the episode, read it online, and then not watch it. It's very, very it's a very self-contained episode. It's basically a movie in itself and which is amazing. And it's an amazing movie and very sad and very touching."
"James","00:27:28:04","00:27:53:08","And it's more touching than sad. Like, it is very sad. The ending, of course, But I feel like it's very touching showing that, you know, two people of the same gender to people of the same sex can have such a deep connection with each other. And I think it's important to show that kind of stuff. And I think it kind of shocked a lot of straight viewers watching it because they were not expecting that because that wasn't in the game."
"James","00:27:54:02","00:28:17:17","So big props to the writers, by the way. One of the it's basically got two writers, one of the I forget their names off the top of my head. One of them was the showrunner for Chernobyl, which was a fantastic show. And the other one is actually like the head writer of The Last of US games, and he helped to expand these gay characters kind of footprint in the world."
"James","00:28:18:02","00:28:41:09","And they do have a much bigger footprint in the world now. And I think that, you know, that is to be admired. But I do wish that there were there was another gay male character in the Last of US world that would be a recurring character and not just a one off in one episode, because obviously, you know, we're going to have we have Ellie, we're going to have DNA."
"James","00:28:41:15","00:29:04:03","You know, there are queer and we're going to have Lev. There are queer characters that are showing up in The Last of US who are there and who will be there, and Riley and Riley only one episode, but also very I personally and this is weird because I usually I usually when it comes to like books, I almost only read books about gay men."
"James","00:29:04:14","00:29:40:09","Um, or like gay non-binary people, stuff like that. Like, usually like, of gays. And it's not that I like, avoid lesbian content. I just really kind of gravitate toward gay content. But for some reason, um, the most recent episode of The Last of US titled Left Behind, which tells the story of how Ellie got infected and her really close relationship with a girl who was her roommate at the Pedra Training Academy."
"James","00:29:41:01","00:30:07:03","Riley And you know, them having this amazing, wonderful date that ended up being their first and last date, and I'm going to cry now. That ended up being their first and last date because they both got bitten and Riley didn't make it out alive, and Ellie did. And, you know, in the games, Ellie kind of has to deal with a lot of survival guilt, survivor guilt for that."
"James","00:30:07:03","00:30:37:06","And I think we're going to have I think we're probably going to see that in the show at some point as well. Um, but yes, I have seen the last of us. I love it. It's frigging amazing. And, um, episode three I have my Episode three is a phenomenal movie and I wish they I hope they released the long version as a movie because apparently there is a two hour version of that episode and I would love to see it, but I prefer for episode seven Left Behind personally."
"James","00:30:37:23","00:31:03:07","Um, what's next? Let's see. Do, do do. Um, what are some examples of pieces of media or culture where you notice other people enjoying or referencing but have no interest or can't be bothered to clue in on in any way unless motivated by example backers or maybe even then. What do you think makes you bounce off of them?"
"James","00:31:05:04","00:31:27:05","Star Trek is kind of my it's in my blindspot, not, um, it's not that I don't like the idea of Star Trek. I'm very interested by the kind of the world of Star Trek. I've watched documentaries about the world of Star Trek, I've watched YouTube videos about it and stuff like that, and the history and things like that."
"James","00:31:27:12","00:31:45:05","And it's it's really interesting the on the production side of things as well as like the world it takes place and I find it very interesting. But I've never and I mean, I've only a couple of times actually sat down to try and watch Star Trek. I've done it a couple of times recently. I tried to get into Picard, I tried to get into lower decks."
"James","00:31:45:14","00:32:10:16","I tried to watch, um, Deep Space nine. I tried to watch The Next Generation, and I think I tried to watch Voyager. Um, and for some reason, even though, you know, I'll watch an episode or two, I just. It just doesn't grab me. And I don't know why. Because I'm a sci fi nerd. I, you know, I really enjoy kind of futuristic stuff."
"James","00:32:10:16","00:32:48:13","I think the whole concept is really interesting, but for some reason, Star Trek just does not grab me. And even when I'm trying to kind of grab it myself, it just kind of slips through my fingers. For some reason, I can't really explain why. Um, and it's not like, oh, Star Trek isn't interesting or anything like that. It's, I don't know if it's the production value or what it might be, but I've just I've never been able to actually really get into Star Trek, which is kind of unfortunate because I think it would be something I'd really be into if my brain gave me the chance."
"James","00:32:48:22","00:33:14:15","Maybe it's the Star Trek Star Wars dichotomy that I kind of I grew up with Star Wars, and so there's that wall that was built, that Star Wars is inherently better than Star Trek. And so it kind of creates that issue. But yeah, just everything else, like Star Trek is the only one that I've just been like, you know, like everything else that like people have said I should watch."
"James","00:33:15:19","00:33:41:10","Sometimes I like it, sometimes I love it. I have not been asked to watch something by a viewer and I didn't like it. I may not have finished it, um, because it might be like 13 or 14 seasons long. There might be several hundred episodes, but I usually enjoy it like you guys have good taste, you give good recommendations."
"James","00:33:41:21","00:34:07:22","Um, so yeah, Star Star Trek is the only one that really stands out to me as something that I've never in my whole life and able to get into. Um, I just lost the next question. Oh, next question. All right. If you had the budget, would you produce animated content or would you rather stick to live action? I would love to make animated stuff with TALOS."
"James","00:34:08:16","00:34:27:23","I mean, hopefully TALOS will be able to bring in enough money, um, enough revenue that will be able to do some animated stuff because I would, I would love to because animated stuff just opens you up so much more than live action. I mean, even today, there's stuff that unless you're James Cameron, you can't do certain things in live action."
"James","00:34:27:23","00:34:39:20","It's just impossible. Um, you know, you need hundreds of millions of dollars to do it in live action, whereas you can do it for, you know, a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of that in animation."
"Speaker 2","00:34:40:08","00:34:40:22","Um."
"James","00:34:41:12","00:35:02:10","Maybe it would cost me a bit more because I would refuse. I would not be one of those people who underplays the animators because they're kind of important when it comes to animated media. Um, and overworking animators and stuff like that. Like I understand budgets are tight and things like that, but, you know, a good producer makes sure that people are not overworked and things still get done."
"James","00:35:03:02","00:35:23:07","Um, so I would love to do some animated stuff. I actually have like ideas for animated series that I would love to do, but, uh, fingers crossed that we're able to bring in enough revenue with. Tell us this first couple of movies, live action ones that we can dip our toes into animation and see what we can do."
"James","00:35:24:14","00:35:53:14","Um, next question is what's something you love or otherwise just have a lot of feelings about but don't think you could ever cover on the channel and why? Or if there are no limits, what's the most niche thing you think you'd want to talk about? I thought about this one for a long time because all of the things that I loved that I'm like, I probably can't do a video on this."
"James","00:35:53:21","00:36:31:03","I have mentioned in videos like I don't think that I could do a video on Dragon Ball Z, but I've mentioned Dragon Ball Z. I don't think I could do a full video about Star Wars, but I've mentioned Star Wars. Um, I don't think I could do a full video about, um, Gundam Wing, but I've mentioned Gundam Wing, so there's nothing that I use them as examples in greater context, but it's stuff that I'm, I can't, I can't really think of anything that I'm just like, I love this and I don't think I can ever do a video on it."
"James","00:36:31:17","00:36:58:09","Um, maybe, maybe Sex and the City. Sex and the City is, for a lot of people, what friends is to them. Sex and the City is and was to me. And I don't see how I could make a video about Sex in the City. Maybe I could. I'm definitely willing to. I just don't know what the construction of that would be."
"James","00:36:58:23","00:37:39:04","Um, as for, um, what's the most niche thing that I want to talk about? The most niche thing, honestly, is probably like, I don't know, like action figures, toys, Lego, like I have a huge Lego collection, a huge action figure collection. I'm a nerd. Okay. Just in case you didn't know. And I don't think I could ever make a video about that."
"James","00:37:39:16","00:38:07:15","Um, but I might be able to, you know, I don't know how. How I would relate it to weird. Um, but I've, you know, I've done some stuff that wasn't entirely queer based before, like with Stranger Things where I just completely forgot to mention Wil and Robin and attack on Titan, where I'm. I barely mentioned the that I don't even know if I mentioned that Haji was nonbinary in that video."
"James","00:38:07:15","00:38:37:17","So yeah. Um, next question. You mentioned on several occasions that you prefer to binge watch. I tend to do that as well, but have been finding certain shows. I prefer watching week to week because I enjoy them that much and find it worth it. Recently I had a situation where I accidentally binge the show that I realized later I would have probably enjoyed more if I spread it out week to week and I was wondering if you ever had one of these realizations in the middle of binge watching a show."
"James","00:38:38:15","00:39:04:17","Um, no. I am a huge binge watcher like shows that I will watch week to week are oddly, they're all queer horror shows. So Interview with the Vampire, Chucky and The Last of US. I will watch these week to week Bob's Burgers as well, But Bob's Burgers is kind of like a that's not a sort of appointment television."
"James","00:39:04:17","00:39:32:01","So much for me, so much as I have Bob's Burgers on in the background all the time. So a new episode is just kind of something fresh. Um, but yeah, it's those, those three shows are the ones that I'm kind of I'm willing to wait in between episodes, partially because I don't want to get spoiled and partially because I just need more of it."
"James","00:39:32:01","00:39:53:15","I need more of those characters. I can't wait. I need to come back every week. But other than that, I. I binge watch everything like I love when I'm recommended a TV show and it's like, Oh, you should watch this. It's really good, but it's over. I'm like, fucking, yeah, I can watch the whole thing. I'm not waiting around for the next season."
"James","00:39:54:01","00:40:14:06","Like, that's what happened with the attack on Titan. I watched, um, season one. Season two, Season three, Season four, Part one, Season four, Part two. And I was like, Why is there no ending? And then I read the manga, and this week I think tomorrow the final season starts airing and I'm going to watch it week to week."
"James","00:40:14:06","00:40:33:07","I don't think the English dub will be done for it. I'll watch it with subtitles. I don't care, because I really want to see what they do with the ending if they actually keep the ending from the manga. I think that'll be really interesting to see. Okay. I think that answer that question, If not, call me out in the comments."
"James","00:40:34:14","00:40:50:11","Next question. I was wondering if you've watched the latest season of American Horror Story. It's set during New York City in the 1980s and a gay killer is on the loose. I'd never seen cruising, but I watched it to prepare. And a lot of the show, both references and kind of flips off, in my opinion, a lot of the stuff from cruising."
"James","00:40:51:00","00:41:23:11","I haven't finished it yet. I'm in the process of right now, but so far it feels like the most queer series, even though it's mostly white, cis, gay men. There's some anger and some precedents, but I don't know if I'd call it a queer horror per se, just horror with queer in it and some queer horror lights. For want of a better word, though sometimes I found a quote I sometimes I found quite good is that pretty much everyone in the gay, LGBT, even minor roles, it is refreshing."
"James","00:41:23:16","00:41:46:10","Anyway, I'm fairly new here, so maybe you've touched on this before. I thank you for the question. Gothic. I hope you're listening. I have watched American Horror Story season 11. I think it was New York City which had a really interesting release model, talking about the bingeing thing where they released two episodes every week instead of one, which was much better than the one episode week."
"James","00:41:46:20","00:42:14:13","Um, I absolutely loved it. I think it might be my going back. Like you think about, like asylum in Coven. And I also really loved American Horror Story Apocalypse, but that might be just because I am madly in love with Cody. Fern But I absolutely loved this season because it was very realistic and gothic. I have talked about it in my best game idea of 2022 video."
"James","00:42:14:23","00:42:45:11","Um, Nick and I both are in that video actually. Um, so gothic. I won't spoil the way it ends, just in case you haven't gotten to the ending just yet. Um, but it, it really gets down to queer horror specifically, and a very potent queer horror that I was shocked they went there and I really appreciated it. Okay, only a couple of questions left, and we're running good on time."
"James","00:42:46:05","00:43:18:04","Okay. Next question is not sure if this has been asked before, but do you have siblings? And if so, how do you get along with them? I do have a half sister from my dad's first marriage. I have not spoken to her since I was five or six years old. Um, a whole lot of drama there. Basically, she was turned against my dad by her mom."
"James","00:43:19:05","00:43:42:22","Her mom really did not like the fact that my mom and my dad were kind of surrogate parents to to my half sister, which I feel like, you know, that's probably a good thing, especially because, you know, my mom really cared about her and and everything. And and she and I were really close up until I was five or six when she graduated from high school."
"James","00:43:42:22","00:44:06:06","She was quite a bit older than me, Um, I think 12 years older. Um, and she graduated from high school and she decided she wanted nothing to do with my dad anymore, and we couldn't figure out why the hell that had happened. And she didn't want anything to do with me anymore, or my mom or anyone. Um, she barely spoke to anyone in the family, even."
"James","00:44:06:20","00:44:34:11","And we eventually found out that her mother basically had kind of poisoned her against the the rest of the family. Really? Because, like, my whole dad's side of the family, you know, she is blood related. And on my mom's side of the family, they considered her, you know, a granddaughter or niece, um, or a cousin. And yeah, so it was really weird for her to just disappear like that."
"James","00:44:34:11","00:44:51:21","And I know, like, as of today, I have two nephews. I've never met them, which is kind of, you know, it's sad for me because I would love to meet my nephews. Um, but, you know, they're, they're quite young and, I mean, they I live in Toronto and they live in Nova Scotia now. So that's meeting that was kind of off the table at the moment."
"James","00:44:52:07","00:45:13:15","Um, but, you know, I would have been such, I would have been the uncle that shows up at Christmas and just like, spoils them rotten. Like that's the kind of uncle I would have been. So, you know, they kind of missed out on having a really nice, generous uncle who would actually like, you know, I'm into nerd stuff, video games and stuff."
"James","00:45:13:15","00:45:40:04","I play with them and they kind of miss out on that because their mom is weird. And we've like looked into it to see, like, did my father actually, like, do anything to cause her? And it's like, no, this, this all came from her mom, which is really disappointing. Um, but yeah, happy, happy podcast. Uh, the next is out of the books that you have read."
"James","00:45:40:04","00:46:00:10","Is there a character with whom you identified or see as yourself and how if, if not person in how, if not personal? And who do you think of regularly? Also, have you read any of the Robin Hobb books related to the realm of the underlings? I only read one Robin Hobb book, but I didn't finish it. Apparently it's her weakest book."
"James","00:46:01:01","00:46:25:13","Um, I can remember, I think Assassin's Apprentice. I think I've been told that it's her weakest book. I'm sure someone listening, It might be their favorite book. I'm not judging, but, um, I actually have a I have a hard time reading fantasy. It's weird, considering that I'm such a huge nerd. Like, I've read Lord of the Rings. Um, The King Killer Chronicles and most of Song of Ice and Fire."
"James","00:46:25:14","00:46:51:11","I had to skip over some of it because I'm like, Okay, there's only so many tens of pages I can read about food. Um, but yeah, with fantasy, it's hard for me to get into fantasy for some reason. I don't know. Maybe it's the very florid writing that a lot of fantasy user fantasy writers use. Um, although Andras had very, very florid writing and I love I loved and do love Anne Rice, even though she's passed on."
"James","00:46:52:01","00:47:19:21","Um, as for what fictional character do I see myself or identify as? I never really identified with any fictional characters from books until I read boyfriend material. Um, and that the main character in that book and the sequel husband material. Luke I really identified with him. It was the first book I had read that was like about gay adults."
"James","00:47:19:21","00:47:44:22","I'd been reading a lot of gay way, and this was the first time that I was like, Oh, gay adults who don't completely have their shit together. Wow. And so I really started identifying with Luke, like, I wish I was skinny as he's very skinny and I wish I had his body type. But other than that, I feel like we share a lot of similarities, but I also share a lot of similarities with Oliver, the guy he ends up being in a relationship with."
"James","00:47:45:08","00:48:09:17","Um, I'm a little bit of both of them, which is why I love those books so much. And I like if I had my way, that series would go on forever. And the author, Alexis Hall, is actually a subscriber to the channel. So I love that. And we have one more question. And oddly, this is the last question that was submitted, and it's an interesting one."
"James","00:48:10:03","00:48:34:09","Uh, did your career choices or ideas ever change and did your identity influence your career? Pathway Um, yes, my career path and choices changed a lot when I was young. When I was very little, I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to help people. Um, and then this was when I was like very little when I was like three, four or five, six."
"James","00:48:34:21","00:48:56:20","And then once I got about halfway through elementary school, I realized, well, I didn't realize my teachers informed me that I was very argumentative and I was always willing to push back on everything they said if there wasn't, like, firm proof that they could show me of a rule I needed to follow or a fact that they were talking about, I wanted the facts."
"James","00:48:57:07","00:49:31:16","They were like, You should be a lawyer. And so then I was like, from probably 7 to 11, I wanted to be a lawyer. And I actually did consider that when I was going to business school, I thought, okay, when I finish business school, I might go to law school, um, and work as a defense attorney. But, um, when I was 11 years old, I was I watched A&E, the channel A&E used to have a biography series."
"James","00:49:31:16","00:49:55:15","I don't know if they still do, but they had a biography, a special two hour episode of biography about Steven Spielberg. And for some reason, even I was 11 years old. That was the first time it clicked that, oh, people make movies like obviously you see, like the actors and stuff like that. But the people behind the cameras, the writers, the producers, the editors, the directors, the cinematographers, you don't see them when you're watching movies."
"James","00:49:55:15","00:50:17:19","And you certainly you probably don't even think of them as a kid. I didn't, you know, and I realized, Oh my God, people do this. This is a job. And that was when I was 11 and I just stuck to I want to be a director. Um, there was a slight layover in. This is never going to happen."
"James","00:50:18:03","00:50:46:10","I need to find something else that I don't hate, which ended up being, um, advertising. My problem was that, uh, a lot of people equate marketing and advertising. They're different having gone to school, got my degrees and worked in marketing. Advertising and marketing are different. Advertising is very creative. You know, it's coming up with advertising campaigns, it's coming up with commercials and posters and billboards and stuff like that."
"James","00:50:46:10","00:51:15:16","Whereas marketing is very data driven. It's looking at analytics and deciding what choice to make and stuff like that, which I was very good at. But I hated it and I wanted to work in advertising. But getting in to actual advertising agencies at least where I was, was really, really different. Difficult. It was very cutthroat, mostly because a lot of the advertising agencies would hire business graduates who had interned for them, and I couldn't afford to be an intern."
"James","00:51:17:14","00:51:56:19","And so I never had a shot at getting into an advertising agency. And so I worked in market. I had that stop over in marketing, but it wasn't my favorite thing. And the entire time I was doing that, I still wanted to make movies. And, you know, I just kept telling myself, I'm doing this so that I can make the money to make a low budget movie and I just kept telling myself that even though I was barely making enough to pay rent with a roommate, Nick and I were still living together at the time and it wasn't really until, um, the, the YouTube channel took off."
"James","00:51:57:08","00:52:19:05","Um, I was still working in marketing then I was working for a, a university. Well, it wasn't a university, it was a post grad kind of certification system for accountants. And I was doing the marketing for them and I got to do a little bit of creative stuff. I got to do some videos and I got to do, um, design some billboards and stuff like that."
"James","00:52:19:05","00:52:43:08","I completely revamped, revamped the branding of, of the organization they have since since I've left, they have gone back to the old stuff, which makes me sad because the old stuff is really boring. Um, but, and I know that my stuff was working because I saw the numbers of new applicants coming in for the program. So I knew my stuff was working."
"James","00:52:43:20","00:53:03:17","So I don't know why they went back to the old stuff, but there was that stop over. But I was working that job when YouTube kind of took off. And when I say took off, the Monsters in the Closet video got like 10,000 views and I was like, Oh my God, I'm famous. And I even though I was like, I can't."
"James","00:53:03:17","00:53:27:10","I'm not I, I never thought I could make enough money off of YouTube to just do that. So I continued working in the doing the marketing role and lucked out that when the marketing role ended, um, was right around the time the killing stalking video came out. And it was right around that time that we started to get a bit more, a bit more patrons."
"James","00:53:27:10","00:53:58:13","At that point we had about 500 patrons. Um, we've got like 2500 now, which is a huge jump, I think 26 closer to 2700, I think. Um, and so we had, you know, we were bringing in more patrons. The killing stalking video was the first video that really brought a lot of ad revenue to the channel. And so just as I was let go from that position, YouTube kind of took off again in another way."
"James","00:53:58:22","00:54:25:02","I was like, okay, maybe we can do this. Um, and but I was very focused on and so I guess my career path kind of went from doctor to lawyer to filmmaker to marketer to YouTube. Ah, and now back to director. Um, and the reason I say it's really gone back to director, I love making YouTube videos, by the way."
"James","00:54:25:02","00:54:49:21","Like I would release video a week if we could write them fast enough. But you know, Nick needs to eat and breathe. So and Nick is the main writer on the channel. Um, we're actually splitting the writing responsibilities a lot more evenly now. Um, but, but yeah, I would, I'd put, I'd be putting videos out every day just because I love editing and I love shooting and stuff like that."
"James","00:54:49:21","00:55:26:03","It's the writing is just such a pain in the ass. But when my, when we knew that my mom was going to die, she was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer. Um, that they, they tried treating her for it and there was just no progress. And, um, when we knew she was going to die and she decided that she was going to go through it's called in Canada Medical Assistance in Dying and it's, you know, assisted suicide basically."
"James","00:55:26:03","00:55:49:23","But medical assistance in dying is a much nicer way of saying it. She decided she was going to go through that because the doctor said, you've got six or eight months and probably five of them you're you're going to be in hospice. She was like, I'm not doing that. And so we knew for a couple of months the date that my mom was going to die, which was really surreal knowing that date."
"James","00:55:52:12","00:56:19:10","And she was like, I want one more Christmas. And then in January we're going to we're going to do it. And so on January 8th of 2022, we did that and I've talked about that on Streams a lot. There's a lot of stories. But that night she said to me she had an insurance policy. She had to at the time she had two."
"James","00:56:19:10","00:56:57:23","One was for me and one was for my dad. And she told me, I want you to take that money and I want you to make a movie. And that was kind of her dying wish. And then the insurance actually screwed us over and didn't give us the money. But then I put out the the the I, I put out the, uh, Indiegogo campaign for Telos, and you guys came forward with so much more support than I could have ever imagined."
"James","00:56:59:01","00:57:26:21","And so I'm going to make a movie. Um, I'm going to make several movies. I'm. I am not going to let that dream that I had when I was 11 years old of when I figured out that, oh, this is this is something that people do. When I discovered that and I just got married to that idea and I never let go of that idea that was always there."
"James","00:57:27:21","00:57:49:19","Although, you know, it took the backseat for you to it took the backseat for marketing jobs. It was always there. And now I have the opportunity to do that. So I'm going to do that. And I feel like when there's one thing that you want to be and you decide you want to be that at 11 and at 34, that's still what you want to be."
"James","00:57:50:07","00:58:17:19","I feel like that's probably the direction you're meant to go in and as far as my identity influencing my career path, I don't think it has as far as being a gay man, although, you know, gays are notoriously creative. So, you know, going into wanting to go into advertising because it was the creative version of marketing and wanting to be a filmmaker kind of does play into that."
"James","00:58:17:19","00:58:40:21","But I don't I don't think being gay specifically played into it, but I do want to tell queer stories. And that's that's hopefully what the point of Telos will be, is that we'll be able to tell queer stories. And, you know, if they become giant blockbusters, if we get to make stories with other studios like A24 or Blumhouse, that would be amazing."
"James","00:58:43:11","00:59:17:14","But like, my dream is for Telos to become self-sustainable, to be able to produce movies and pay the salaries for people you know, working on the movies as well as to pay, you know, ongoing salaries for people like development executives and producers and stuff like that. And so that we can open it up to a wider range of stories so that it's not just about gay men or lesbians, that it's about trans people and non-binary characters and characters of color, which I'm doing blind casting."
"James","00:59:17:14","00:59:50:16","So, you know, as far as that goes. So hopefully the movies will start off quite diverse as far as characters of color go. And also, you know, characters with disabilities and things like that. Like I want to make Telos into this this studio that is, that's there for everyone, uh, that every queer person can have a movie, a favorite telos movie that they can go to, to maybe feel better about themselves, to laugh, to be scared, whatever it might be."
"James","00:59:50:16","01:00:14:08","That's, that's my goal for it. And I hope hopefully I can make that my career. That's that. That's the dream. That's the dream. So we'll see. We'll see if that works out. Um, so that's the end of the submitted questions. Um, so that'll be the end of this episode of the Patreon. I'm not going to say Nic's going to be on the next episode because he's probably not."
"James","01:00:14:08","01:00:38:04","But if you have a topic that you'd like to hear me talk about on the next Patreon, please do let me know their message. Me on Discord or um, here on Patreon in the YouTube comments, whatever it might be. Um, if there's a topic that you'd like to hear me talk about, let me know because I, I want to talk about what you guys want to hear me talk about."
"James","01:00:38:04","01:01:03:16","I am open to all suggestions, so thank you for sending me your questions. It was a lot I, I told you I could ramble on for an hour. It was a lot of fun. And, um, I hope you enjoyed the podcast. And, uh, probably see you soon on a livestream because I'll be bored, and so I'll be livestreaming as usual."
"James","01:01:04:19","01:01:14:05","So thank you all. Thank you all for being patrons. I love and adore you all. You are amazing. And yeah, I hope you have a great week."

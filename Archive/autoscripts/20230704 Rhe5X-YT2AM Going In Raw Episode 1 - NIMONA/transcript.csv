"Speaker 1","00:00:00:04","00:00:18:01","I enjoy naked in the sights of your body running through my head. It's hard to escape the past. Every time I say something, I really want to take it back. Sensitive. I'm peeling back my skin."
"Speaker 2","00:00:18:05","00:00:19:09","Get damaged by."
"James Somerton","00:00:20:19","00:00:39:02","Hello, everyone, and welcome to the inaugural episode of Going In Raw, where we watch a movie and then immediately give you our live reactions to it. The first movie we were talking about actually wasn't on the list because we just decided to watch it and have this be the opening episode. And that first movie is Nimona. And now I'm going to let Nick talk."
"James Somerton","00:00:39:02","00:00:39:12","Hi, Nick."
"Nick Herrgott","00:00:39:15","00:00:47:05","Hi, I'm Nick. And everything that happened, everything that James is saying is true."
"James Somerton","00:00:47:06","00:00:48:22","It is true. It is."
"Speaker 2","00:00:49:09","00:00:50:08","True. It is."
"James Somerton","00:00:50:08","00:00:50:21","In fact."
"Speaker 2","00:00:50:21","00:00:52:07","Go figure!"
"James Somerton","00:00:52:07","00:01:05:06","In fact, fact. So yeah, the-the idea of this podcast is that it is for patrons and YouTube members and that we will watch a movie."
"Nick Herrgott","00:01:05:13","00:01:07:15","Content, we will watch a content."
"James Somerton","00:01:07:22","00:01:20:04","A content that we have either never seen before, at least one of us has never seen before, or we haven't seen in a very long time and watch it and then immediately record our thoughts."
"Nick Herrgott","00:01:20:04","00:01:23:11","Give our unadulterated thoughts. Because when James and I normally watch."
"Speaker 2","00:01:23:13","00:01:24:06","Thoughts."
"Nick Herrgott","00:01:24:23","00:01:37:05","And James and I normally watch a movie, TV show or whatever, we talk about it for eons before it ends up appearing in a video. So this is this is our raw thoughts about that. Yeah, we haven't we haven't discussed it at all."
"James Somerton","00:01:37:05","00:01:58:14","We'll leave a movie theater and just like blabber for the entire drive back to wherever we live. So we just watched Nimona, which is available on Netflix and is and is in some theaters and so do you want to kind of give an idea of what Nimona is?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:01:58:23","00:02:00:07","So are we going to do spoilers?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:02:05:01","00:02:09:04","I mean, it's hard it'll be hard to kind of to fill the time without giving spoilers."
"James Somerton","00:02:09:04","00:02:15:13","Yeah, it's not. It's not it's not the type of movie that if you know how it ends, it's going to ruin it for you."
"Nick Herrgott","00:02:15:13","00:02:16:07","It's it's little."
"James Somerton","00:02:16:09","00:02:18:09","We don't need to talk about the ending ending."
"Nick Herrgott","00:02:18:09","00:02:26:20","Plot wise it's literally every animated. Yeah and show TV what it's it's it's the format and that and that's okay."
"James Somerton","00:02:26:21","00:02:32:00","So basically a night who is lower born a dude who's lower."
"Nick Herrgott","00:02:32:00","00:02:41:00","But first of all we have to set the setting. So this is a world where there is a society that is surrounded by walls that are terrified of monsters outside the walls. Think attack of Titan, but for kids."
"Speaker 2","00:02:41:08","00:02:41:16","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:02:44:08","00:02:46:14","So yeah. So it takes place in that kind of society."
"Nick Herrgott","00:02:46:14","00:02:54:03","And there's a kind of you kind of equated it to a religion of lifting up certain individuals to this this well, there's this."
"James Somerton","00:02:54:03","00:02:57:23","There's this huge hero worship for this."
"Nick Herrgott","00:02:58:21","00:02:59:14","The first night."
"James Somerton","00:02:59:17","00:03:18:17","The first night who, you know, she slayed this monster a thousand years ago. And now every so often, new knights are added to the sort of regimen of knighthood. But they're all honorable, Sean. They're all like, Highborn. Yeah. And the first one that becomes a knight who isn't."
"Nick Herrgott","00:03:18:17","00:03:22:19","Highborn This is cause for controversy."
"James Somerton","00:03:22:22","00:03:32:18","Yes, lots of people are not happy about this. And he is framed for the murder of the queen. And so he has to figure out how to, you know."
"Nick Herrgott","00:03:32:18","00:03:33:04","Clear his."
"James Somerton","00:03:33:04","00:03:35:11","Name and in doing so meets."
"Nick Herrgott","00:03:35:11","00:03:36:10","This encounter."
"James Somerton","00:03:36:11","00:03:38:22","Crazy ass being called the Mona."
"Nick Herrgott","00:03:39:04","00:03:41:18","An impish young lady. Occasionally."
"James Somerton","00:03:42:12","00:03:43:10","Sometimes a boy."
"Nick Herrgott","00:03:43:10","00:03:48:05","Today, a boy today. I called her immediately, like, Oh, that's the monster."
"Speaker 2","00:03:48:12","00:03:48:20","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:03:49:18","00:04:05:13","So, like, spoilers, like this is a first act thing, so don't even feel bad, but we are going to get the spoiler, so be careful. And she sets out on a quest with him initially because he she thinks that he's out to sort of topple the establishment government and you know."
"James Somerton","00:04:05:19","00:04:07:12","Which needs some toppling which."
"Nick Herrgott","00:04:07:14","00:04:12:02","Which she believes is in need of some toppling. Yeah, probably more toppling that is needed."
"Speaker 2","00:04:12:10","00:04:12:20","Yes."
"Nick Herrgott","00:04:14:09","00:04:19:13","But he's out to clear his name and so she's like, okay, well, clear your name and then we'll be friends. And then he's like, Deal."
"James Somerton","00:04:20:06","00:04:29:22","For everyone listening. I just adjusted the volume a little bit. I hope that's all right. I think I did. I adjusted, I did something. I did something. But yeah, continue."
"Nick Herrgott","00:04:29:22","00:04:57:07","James Summerton Channel Audio Problems Trademark new audio recorder. So a little bit of slack. So they set out on a quest to figure out what's going on to clear his name and, you know, haphazard, circumstantial evidence. Zach, in a moment, it's all there. But yeah, it's perfectly fine because it's very it's about the characters and their interactions and what's trying to say, Yeah, I read earlier that pneumonia as a trans allegory."
"James Somerton","00:04:57:09","00:05:06:08","And I didn't, I didn't sort of I hadn't I knew nothing about this going on and I knew lots of people said that it was like really gay. And I was like, okay, it's gay. Like Luca."
"Nick Herrgott","00:05:06:12","00:05:09:16","I didn't hear about the gay stuff. I heard about the trans allegory stuff."
"James Somerton","00:05:09:16","00:05:12:11","Okay? So I heard that it was that it was gay."
"Nick Herrgott","00:05:12:12","00:05:15:02","And like, right for first scene, it's gay. Yeah."
"Speaker 2","00:05:15:12","00:05:17:12","They kiss the kiss."
"James Somerton","00:05:17:20","00:05:19:06","Not at the beginning, but at the end. They kiss."
"Nick Herrgott","00:05:20:00","00:05:22:01","But at the beginning they're holding hands and it's like."
"James Somerton","00:05:22:08","00:05:32:12","Resting on each other. And like, I thought, it's very apparent. I was like, okay, it's gay. Like Luke is gay, all right, you're fine or whatever. So I was really kind of shocked when I was like, Oh my God. Oh, but touching it."
"Nick Herrgott","00:05:32:13","00:05:39:11","But no, I mean, a major plot point of the entire series is that this is kind of like a jilted lover status they fucking like."
"James Somerton","00:05:41:00","00:05:55:11","And so the main character is gay and his love interest and the main character is voiced by a resumed who doesn't get nearly enough work. And his love interest is played by Eugene Liang, who is Eugene from the Dry Guys."
"Nick Herrgott","00:05:56:07","00:05:57:21","The group formerly known as the Dry Guys."
"James Somerton","00:05:58:04","00:05:59:12","Yeah, I don't really think they're."
"Nick Herrgott","00:05:59:18","00:06:01:14","They don't really dry, literally dry much anymore."
"James Somerton","00:06:01:19","00:06:02:02","They don't."
"Nick Herrgott","00:06:04:02","00:06:05:13","One guy tried to apologize."
"Speaker 2","00:06:05:15","00:06:07:01","That didn't work out right."
"James Somerton","00:06:09:16","00:06:22:07","And they and so there's this like, you know and he's basically a cop. Yeah. And so he's like, I've got to, you know, take him in whether I love him or not. I have to find him and, you know, bring him to justice."
"Nick Herrgott","00:06:22:07","00:06:26:13","And there's some serious I was like, meet after me off the bat, like, don't take him back."
"James Somerton","00:06:27:02","00:06:27:08","Oh, yeah."
"Speaker 2","00:06:27:08","00:06:30:12","You do not like you were pissed. But that's kind of."
"Nick Herrgott","00:06:30:12","00:06:34:16","My ending point, is that, you know, they do get back together at the end. And I was like, Now na na."
"Speaker 2","00:06:34:16","00:06:36:01","Now there."
"Nick Herrgott","00:06:36:11","00:06:39:12","There was some betrayed trust. On several occasions I."
"James Somerton","00:06:39:14","00:06:53:08","There was, there was much betrayed trust. Yeah. I just assumed that, you know, between the, the, the ending and then the ending ending where you see them back together, it was like kind of something had happened, you know, they kind of."
"Nick Herrgott","00:06:54:10","00:06:58:14","Parted ways, but, you know, they want to have gay representations. They need to have happy gays and not, you know."
"James Somerton","00:06:59:00","00:07:20:00","Which I, I want to Netflix. There's lots of stuff that pisses a lot of people off. I want to give them some props for actually making this movie because it was supposed to be a Disney movie and it was in pre-production at Disney. I think it may have actually been in production and Bob Chapek took over and axed it."
"James Somerton","00:07:21:10","00:07:25:03","It was then picked up for production by Annapurna Pictures."
"Nick Herrgott","00:07:25:06","00:07:28:04","Which is another A24 esque arthouse."
"James Somerton","00:07:28:04","00:07:42:05","Yeah, Annapurna Pictures is basically it's run by Megan Ellison. Her dad, like, owns Nike, so he's like super rich and he gave her a bunch of money and said, Do something with your life. Here's money I'm not giving you anymore. Yeah. And she became a film producer and she's been amazing, you know?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:07:42:05","00:07:42:23","Wasn't that Laker?"
"James Somerton","00:07:43:16","00:07:45:07","Both of them. They're like sister."
"Nick Herrgott","00:07:45:10","00:07:46:22","Wow. They have. That's a family."
"James Somerton","00:07:46:22","00:08:01:14","Yeah, Like David that worked. And so she does really Annapurna Pictures does really interesting movies. And so they did this. Netflix bought it. I don't know if they bought it or if they finished it, whatever it might have been. But like big props to Netflix for."
"Nick Herrgott","00:08:01:15","00:08:01:20","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:08:01:20","00:08:06:19","So we're getting this out on Pride Month but bad props to Netflix for not advertising it more."
"Nick Herrgott","00:08:06:19","00:08:17:08","Yeah, well that's how it goes So word of mouth spread it. But yeah Nimona herself, the character is definitely a trans allegory. What's the deal is she's not a typical monster. She's a shapeshifter."
"James Somerton","00:08:17:08","00:08:20:22","Which I don't know. If I don't know, I would say genderqueer because, like, she like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:08:21:08","00:08:25:03","We were getting there. They literally we were getting there because."
"James Somerton","00:08:25:03","00:08:26:19","They literally, literally like, boy."
"Speaker 2","00:08:26:19","00:08:27:20","Today, literally."
"Nick Herrgott","00:08:27:20","00:08:33:00","Every non-binary person in the world is like, what superpower would you pick shapes after like."
"Speaker 2","00:08:33:00","00:08:33:05","That?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:08:33:05","00:08:48:04","That's, that's the thing. It's like, no, I'm very non-binary nonbinary and trans guys with rats like right. Nobody knows why. I mean, with shape terms, it's a little bit more clear because you get to be more whimsical with like gender and sort of fluidity and stuff. Yeah, And."
"James Somerton","00:08:48:21","00:08:55:03","And they're very like, like they shift into armadillos and a whale."
"Nick Herrgott","00:08:57:07","00:08:58:17","Like, I like the shark. The shark."
"James Somerton","00:08:58:17","00:09:05:18","Was nice. Oh, the surface adorable. But the the asshole Nate, who was just, like, constantly scared about the whale showing up again. Just kind of."
"Nick Herrgott","00:09:06:00","00:09:07:08","Yeah, that was that was like."
"James Somerton","00:09:07:09","00:09:08:05","That tickled me."
"Speaker 2","00:09:08:08","00:09:08:19","Um."
"Nick Herrgott","00:09:09:18","00:09:24:10","So the thing about, like, Nimona being, like, a trans allegory is because a lot of the lines directed at trans people, like what are yes, there was a lot of that coded language, not so coded language kind of put in there like."
"James Somerton","00:09:24:20","00:09:44:23","Like asking like, what are you why can't you just be this? Yeah, like a lot of that and not even coming from like a malicious place, but just like, asking, like, why can't you just be normal and, like, her getting really upset at that? Yeah, because you can tell she's been asked that for a long time and she's over it now."
"Nick Herrgott","00:09:45:00","00:09:48:09","Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not the first person to ask this question, sir."
"Speaker 2","00:09:48:10","00:09:48:16","Like, Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:09:48:23","00:09:57:07","She like, congratulations. You ask the question I've been asked for the last thousand years. Bravo. So like. And also she's a thousand years old."
"Nick Herrgott","00:09:57:08","00:10:03:19","Yeah, she's least old. Yeah, at least it seemed like she was around the pond by the time she started turning into humans."
"James Somerton","00:10:03:23","00:10:05:06","Yeah, that's. Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:05:16","00:10:07:06","And one question I came away from with."
"James Somerton","00:10:07:06","00:10:09:17","All those that she didn't turn into a human until she first saw."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:09:17","00:10:13:07","One. Yeah, It seems like she only really turns into things when she wants companionship."
"James Somerton","00:10:13:07","00:10:17:03","Yeah. Which I want a sequel. I want to find out, like, is she some kind of nature spirit? Yeah. Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:17:10","00:10:26:01","What's going on there? Another question I had is like, there's the whole like, it is very attack on Titan. They don't go outside the walls. They. They don't go outside the walls. Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:10:26:08","00:10:27:20","Because outside the walls are monsters."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:27:20","00:10:31:19","And at the end there's an indication that there is now travel outside the walls."
"James Somerton","00:10:31:19","00:10:34:14","It's an indication they show the wall has been broken."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:34:21","00:10:38:01","What I mean by the indications for what purpose are they going outside the walls now?"
"James Somerton","00:10:38:10","00:10:39:12","Yeah. Like obviously this."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:39:12","00:10:42:13","Resource acquisition is this like, you know, like is it just shows."
"James Somerton","00:10:42:13","00:10:48:02","Like that? It is a an open space. Yeah. It's there's nothing outside. Yeah. It's, it's wilderness."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:48:03","00:10:57:23","Yeah. That's the, that's the rhetoric is that there are monsters everywhere in the wilderness. Yeah. What I wanted to know is like, was it just the one monster that the. Oh I forgot the, the night lady. Not Glinda."
"James Somerton","00:10:58:13","00:10:59:10","Nope, not Glinda."
"Nick Herrgott","00:10:59:10","00:11:00:02","Not Glinda."
"Speaker 2","00:11:00:16","00:11:01:08","Let me."
"Nick Herrgott","00:11:02:00","00:11:16:10","It's unimportant the head night lady. Like it's not clear whether she because I would have even read that Nimona and there's night lady encountered later in later in night lady's life where she could properly vanquish this foe with the proper sword. And."
"James Somerton","00:11:16:15","00:11:27:05","Well, that's what I meant by like, there was a religion around it because spoilers for a bit later on you find out that you know the legend that you heard."
"Nick Herrgott","00:11:27:05","00:11:29:07","At the very end of the night vanquishing the monster."
"James Somerton","00:11:29:07","00:11:31:09","Was really two little girls."
"Nick Herrgott","00:11:31:09","00:11:34:18","Two little girls and one having all decided that the other little girl was a monster."
"James Somerton","00:11:34:19","00:11:56:20","Yeah, Even though they had been best friends, she decided she was a monster and it was a wooden sword. She didn't, like, vanquish her and everything. But a religion was built up around this myth. Yeah, and I found that really interesting. Just the sort of commentary on, like, how things change in the telling. Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:11:56:20","00:12:03:21","So for that, like, I, there are two things I had I had about that thought it was you brought it up is the first is like are there other monsters in this world."
"James Somerton","00:12:04:04","00:12:08:06","Yeah like art because in the end the monster she turns into is really cool. It's very."
"Nick Herrgott","00:12:08:06","00:12:17:01","Miyazaki. Like, is she the only like, this was a mix of attack on Titan and Miyazaki. Know that specific Miyazaki movie? Princess Mononoke?"
"James Somerton","00:12:17:08","00:12:17:18","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:12:18:20","00:12:24:00","So, like, I also want to know, like, did Nimona and her blond and Blondie."
"James Somerton","00:12:25:06","00:12:25:19","Blondie."
"Nick Herrgott","00:12:26:06","00:12:39:10","Glinda, Lady Knight lending her name Galadriel or Gloria? Laura. Gloria did they re encounter in a more later more climactic way where you did get these kind of murals of this giant monster."
"James Somerton","00:12:39:10","00:12:42:21","Kind of yeah Or was it really just for these two little girls."
"Nick Herrgott","00:12:42:21","00:12:44:05","They can way out of proportion?"
"James Somerton","00:12:44:05","00:12:46:20","Yeah, that it was blown up. You know, given how."
"Nick Herrgott","00:12:46:20","00:12:55:11","Much pageantry is kind of built up around Gloria, I'd say that there was I would I would have that indicates to me that there would have been another conflict later."
"James Somerton","00:12:55:12","00:12:57:09","Maybe evenly. And this is just me kind of like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:12:57:14","00:13:00:15","Not that it really not that it matters. I'm just head canning."
"James Somerton","00:13:00:18","00:13:18:00","Well, yeah. And it's like I'm sort of spitballing ideas here that maybe even later in life they didn't make up. But like Nimona kind of said, like, I'm going to give you something and pretended to be slain. Yeah, And that created Glau. It's kind of."
"Nick Herrgott","00:13:18:05","00:13:18:14","That big."
"James Somerton","00:13:18:20","00:13:19:17","Forever myth."
"Nick Herrgott","00:13:20:07","00:13:23:10","You know? Just tell your people you can kill me, but tell people to stop hunting."
"James Somerton","00:13:23:10","00:13:39:01","And maybe it's even. She found out like, wait, like you, your people, you you get old and die. I that doesn't happen to me. The only way you can live forever is if there's, you know, a story about you. Yeah, like something like that. Like, that's. That's sequel fodder."
"Nick Herrgott","00:13:39:03","00:13:50:11","Hmm. Another thing is, I didn't quite understand how I felt that, you know, Nimona was watching. Oh, the two gay boys gave away."
"James Somerton","00:13:50:12","00:13:50:21","Boys."
"Nick Herrgott","00:13:51:13","00:13:52:04","Um."
"James Somerton","00:13:52:19","00:13:54:20","Let me see. Here. Let me see. I got. I got it."
"Nick Herrgott","00:13:54:20","00:13:56:14","Golden Loin was one of them. Yes."
"James Somerton","00:13:57:07","00:13:58:13","Ballester bold hers."
"Nick Herrgott","00:13:58:13","00:13:59:00","And."
"James Somerton","00:13:59:03","00:14:01:19","And Ambrosia is golden loin. Yes."
"Nick Herrgott","00:14:02:13","00:14:04:10","Um, like they kind of."
"James Somerton","00:14:04:10","00:14:09:18","I love the names. The names are. It's based on a graphic novel, so it's obviously like playing. Yeah. The sort of."
"Nick Herrgott","00:14:09:18","00:14:32:23","Chivalry they didn't have. They had a similar falling out to Nimona and Glorious. Yeah, I felt like Nimona didn't play off of that enough either in one way or the other. Empathetic or get over him either telling him to get telling Balas to get over him, or kind of sort of, you know, wanting to see how this would play out, you know, And she was certainly sort of a proxy."
"Nick Herrgott","00:14:32:23","00:14:35:03","I felt that there wasn't enough play with that."
"James Somerton","00:14:35:08","00:14:47:22","Yeah. Like, I think my only complaint about the movie right now is like I wish there was another half hour of it. Yeah. Because it was a 90 minute movie and I wish it had been 2 hours. Then you could have seen a bit more of the a bit more back and forth."
"Nick Herrgott","00:14:47:22","00:15:02:04","Like, like I said, I feel like it would have been natural for Nimona, that kind of, you know, from aged excuse me, age and experience, kind of advising people that, no, he's he's not for her, he's not for real. Yeah, he's he's just like all the rest."
"James Somerton","00:15:02:04","00:15:02:11","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:03:02","00:15:03:23","This one's different."
"Speaker 2","00:15:03:23","00:15:04:20","He's a guy."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:07:01","00:15:07:18","And then but."
"James Somerton","00:15:07:18","00:15:09:02","Like, all nightmare bastards."
"Speaker 2","00:15:10:00","00:15:10:20","With the."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:10:20","00:15:12:23","Complexity level of silly."
"Speaker 2","00:15:12:23","00:15:13:08","Cab."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:14:14","00:15:22:06","With the complexity level of She's saying this, but she actually is curious about wanting to know like, is he different? Like, is it. Yeah. Like in another world."
"James Somerton","00:15:22:06","00:15:24:10","And giving him a shot to be different."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:24:14","00:15:30:19","Like in it, but like, you know, being disappointed like, and like sort of what the question like in another world could, could glorify and I have worked out."
"James Somerton","00:15:31:01","00:15:42:13","Hmm Yeah and kind of seeing and maybe even like seeing that oh they did work out in the end and that kind of gives her like a I could have Yeah, we could have been that."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:42:14","00:15:53:06","Yeah. It's sort of just entering, answering the question like, you know, like, okay, I have this burning question answered. I can, you know, I have, you know, unfinished business is finished."
"James Somerton","00:15:53:06","00:15:53:14","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:15:54:03","00:16:02:20","Um, I liked the allusions to trans suicide. Trans and queer suicide. I felt that was just."
"Speaker 2","00:16:04:04","00:16:04:07","Growing."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:04:09","00:16:06:18","Up a little bit. It hit really hard."
"James Somerton","00:16:06:19","00:16:09:14","Well, yeah, like the the the line was."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:10:00","00:16:15:07","I don't know what's worse, whether people are constantly thinking he's a monster or whether I want them to drive, you know, whether whether."
"James Somerton","00:16:15:07","00:16:21:09","Everyone in the kingdom wants to drive a sword through me or if some or what's worse Yeah sometimes I wish they would."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:21:09","00:16:22:07","And then she kind of like."
"James Somerton","00:16:22:12","00:16:23:18","And then in the end, she."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:23:18","00:16:31:19","She props herself up against a giant statue with her heart at the point of a sword sort of aiming to do that. Yeah, I feel bad for spoilers."
"James Somerton","00:16:32:11","00:16:33:15","Well, we said there would be."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:33:15","00:16:36:18","Okay, let's go watch it. It's too late now."
"James Somerton","00:16:36:23","00:16:54:03","Know like, I got, like, kind of emotional when that was happening because like, yeah, I. For what? I wasn't expecting it to go that hard as a kid. I also like, I mean, I was shocked that there were, you know, guys holding hands, let alone guys kissing in the end. But like, the actual like that wasn't even a suicide allegory."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:54:05","00:16:54:15","No, no, no."
"James Somerton","00:16:54:15","00:16:57:01","Her saying, like, sometimes I wish I was dead."
"Nick Herrgott","00:16:57:01","00:17:04:20","Exploring the reasons and purposes for queer suicide. And this is something that I've discussed with some people in my personal life about, like why this happens."
"James Somerton","00:17:04:20","00:17:06:17","But feeling very disconnected from."
"Nick Herrgott","00:17:06:17","00:17:08:13","Her, different from, you know."
"James Somerton","00:17:09:00","00:17:09:15","Just being their."
"Nick Herrgott","00:17:09:15","00:17:12:06","Forms of suicide. Like it's it's, it's."
"James Somerton","00:17:12:13","00:17:31:17","It's, it's different from the and trigger warning. Yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'll put that in the description. Yeah. That, you know, there is, you know, suicidal ideation from being depressed and stuff like that. But it's when, when you're queer it's not so much just like general depression, it's."
"Nick Herrgott","00:17:31:23","00:17:34:06","Feel like you don't get it, like you don't belong in the."
"James Somerton","00:17:34:06","00:17:36:12","World. Yeah. Like there is a targeted depression."
"Nick Herrgott","00:17:36:20","00:17:45:15","There's no like and again, like, it's like she's been at this for a thousand years. There's no reprise. Literally every when she gets close to distance herself because she's different, she's a monster."
"James Somerton","00:17:45:15","00:17:45:22","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:17:45:22","00:17:52:19","So, you know, it's like, what? Is there a point in continuing? Yeah. And that's kind of the ideology that happens for a lot of, you know, queer people."
"James Somerton","00:17:52:22","00:18:10:05","Well, yeah, because it it kind of hangs over you. It's not like the depression that everyone says, you know, you'll go to therapy and things will get better. It's like therapy doesn't make this better. The world needs to get better. Yeah, Yeah. And she at that point in the story, like many queer people, are, like, the world's not getting better."
"Speaker 2","00:18:10:06","00:18:10:13","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:18:10:22","00:18:17:22","It's like, yeah, there I am not. I've been here for a thousand years and it hasn't gotten better."
"Nick Herrgott","00:18:17:22","00:18:23:20","Another thing that I liked was the queer rage in regards to, you know, she's had enough. So she goes on a tirade and so."
"James Somerton","00:18:23:21","00:18:25:16","That when that's when she turns into the."
"Nick Herrgott","00:18:25:16","00:18:26:18","Kaiju. Yeah, the Chi."
"James Somerton","00:18:26:18","00:18:27:10","Just like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:18:27:10","00:18:46:12","And I all I really, really liked that because so many people kind of comment like, Oh, queer people are just so easily triggered. They're just so angry. Yeah, they want to go on there and peop some people that I'm close to say this like they just want to go on tirades for nothing. They're just so centered, they're so just angry, but they're so offended by everything."
"Nick Herrgott","00:18:46:12","00:18:53:12","And it's like, yeah, you're looking at the fifth act of that. Yeah. You don't know what happened that you're."
"James Somerton","00:18:53:12","00:19:05:01","Looking at the, you're looking at the Twitter interaction. Yeah. Where you know someone was, you know, called a name. Yeah. You're not looking at the 30 years that led up to that."
"Nick Herrgott","00:19:05:01","00:19:05:12","Yeah. Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:19:05:16","00:19:07:01","You're not taking that into account."
"Nick Herrgott","00:19:07:01","00:19:15:15","When you're getting to the point of having that rageful person. And this is why I, you know, Thank you. I dropped my fidget dragon. Um, it."
"James Somerton","00:19:15:15","00:19:16:14","Doesn't make any noise."
"Nick Herrgott","00:19:16:14","00:19:30:05","It's perfectly like I give a lot of empathy and, you know, proxy lenience to people who explode on other people online for, you know, like, oh, all I did was ask what pronouns they were using. It's like."
"James Somerton","00:19:30:21","00:19:33:01","Yeah, but that was the 80th time today."
"Nick Herrgott","00:19:33:07","00:19:51:07","And especially like, and trans people who are patrons or YouTube members can, you know, kind of chime in on this. But yeah I kind of direction for people when you know they can conflated like I just don't know what to do I'm like look at someone if they visibly look like they are trying to present feminine face she her."
"James Somerton","00:19:51:16","00:19:54:02","Or just start with they and let them correct you."
"Nick Herrgott","00:19:54:09","00:20:11:17","That can trigger some uh dysphoria for trans people though, like the kind of back back brain like, oh my God, I mean, not passing like. Yeah, that's so that's why I say if it is very apparent that they're trying to go for feminine use, she her because even if it's a guy, even if it's a guy in drag, you're like, ooh, I'm fishy."
"Speaker 2","00:20:11:23","00:20:12:11","Like, yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:20:12:17","00:20:13:06","So like."
"James Somerton","00:20:13:16","00:20:14:23","Ooh, I'm Courtney Act tonight."
"Speaker 2","00:20:14:23","00:20:16:09","Yeah, I'm."
"Nick Herrgott","00:20:16:09","00:20:38:14","Serving Courtney If it looks if they look like they're presenting as masculine used masculine pronouns Yeah it's and I can't quite if it's androgynous if, if it's just a guy with a beard in a skirt use they Yeah. If you are wrong they will correctly correct you. But the important part is it needs to look like you're trying to try."
"Nick Herrgott","00:20:38:15","00:20:42:08","If you see a guy who is, you know, someone who is."
"James Somerton","00:20:42:12","00:20:43:13","You know, and you might see they've."
"Nick Herrgott","00:20:43:13","00:20:48:08","Got masculine features, they've got make, but they've got makeup on, they've got a bit of a shadow and."
"James Somerton","00:20:48:17","00:21:11:18","Look, honestly, like in that kind of situation, like even if it's a situation where it's like someone who is like 100% femme, like just like got the six inch stilettos, like is wearing a miniskirt and everything. And you say she they are very likely to happily correct you as they or he. Yeah, they're not going to get offended because because they know what they're serving."
"Nick Herrgott","00:21:11:18","00:21:23:18","You know what they're serving. You know, people don't people don't get dressed in and dress dressed up in the dark like, yeah, you know, people look at themselves in the mirror when they get dressed. They know what their clothes are. They know what their wardrobe is."
"James Somerton","00:21:23:18","00:21:24:01","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:21:24:23","00:21:44:00","And like I said, if that's not what they're going for, they'll correct you what the element of when it looks like you're, quote unquote, not trying to do this is when you're trying too hard to correct the other direction. You see that person, they've got the shadow, they've got, you know, so so makeup on, masculine features, broad shoulders, but they're still wearing the dress and the full face of makeup anyway."
"Nick Herrgott","00:21:44:00","00:21:46:10","Yeah. And you say he like it's like, okay, what."
"James Somerton","00:21:46:16","00:21:47:21","They are trying their."
"Nick Herrgott","00:21:47:21","00:21:59:02","Best. What what direction are they going in? Either they're trying their best or they're putting on a pass. Either way, if they're putting on a fast and saying she her, that's going to be endearment. Even if they know like, oh honey, you think I'm passing?"
"James Somerton","00:22:00:12","00:22:01:05","Not today."
"Speaker 2","00:22:03:10","00:22:05:12","But thank thank you. Bless your heart."
"James Somerton","00:22:05:12","00:22:08:20","Like I've been in this since 5 p.m. last."
"Speaker 2","00:22:08:20","00:22:09:04","Time."
"James Somerton","00:22:11:11","00:22:18:11","I've done two shows, Anna and a matinee. Okay he's he's closing a bathroom door."
"Nick Herrgott","00:22:18:17","00:22:21:15","Bathroom door. Oh, God. I bumped into. Okay."
"Speaker 2","00:22:21:20","00:22:22:07","Okay."
"James Somerton","00:22:22:14","00:22:24:17","Yeah, The bathroom door closed properly."
"Nick Herrgott","00:22:25:04","00:22:25:13","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:22:25:15","00:22:41:18","Okay. But yeah, like, so for the movie, I. I was so shocked watching the movie just how nonchalantly queer it was. Yeah. How at no point was it like, message. Message Like this night to homophobe? It's like, No, he's actually just an ass, so."
"Nick Herrgott","00:22:41:18","00:22:42:23","He's just an asshole."
"James Somerton","00:22:42:23","00:22:44:22","Yeah, he's. He's just a douche nozzle."
"Nick Herrgott","00:22:44:22","00:22:48:05","Like, if you can still be not homophobic and just be an asshole."
"James Somerton","00:22:48:05","00:22:50:18","Yeah, it was like, Yeah, they're gay. Nobody gives a fuck."
"Nick Herrgott","00:22:50:18","00:22:51:12","Nobody cares."
"James Somerton","00:22:51:16","00:23:00:10","Like, there is no issue brought up about it. It's like if if you're if you're a four year old and you're watching this movie, it's oh, those two nights are holding hands."
"Nick Herrgott","00:23:00:10","00:23:05:07","Because the thing is, society has been conditioned to fear monsters. They don't give a crap who you kiss."
"Speaker 2","00:23:05:12","00:23:07:01","Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"Nick Herrgott","00:23:07:01","00:23:22:09","That's the things. And there's like a this is a broader sense of what you could talk about and kind of my crusade recently is like, people just need something to be afraid of. Yeah. So they're going to pick something. And that's why this kind of LGB movement is not going to work, because the objective."
"James Somerton","00:23:22:09","00:23:24:08","Quiet since the Supreme Court had the."
"Nick Herrgott","00:23:24:09","00:23:36:20","Objective is to be afraid of people. The objective is to find someone to hate is unity through hatred. Yeah. Um. And it doesn't matter who. If someone's been stamped down, they're going to look for something else."
"James Somerton","00:23:37:04","00:23:48:09","Oh, yeah. Like, if, you know, like, right now, you know, there's that meme going around, like we got rid of the non binaries and the trans is and everything. Who's next. And it's the look, it's like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:23:48:09","00:23:51:03","Yeah, it's, it's the maga hat guy kind of looking and just like."
"James Somerton","00:23:51:12","00:23:52:16","Uh, who's the."
"Nick Herrgott","00:23:52:16","00:23:56:03","Anarchist look the unicorn like, Yeah, yeah. Adam Schlesinger That comic, I think. Right."
"James Somerton","00:23:56:07","00:23:56:16","I'm not."
"Nick Herrgott","00:23:56:16","00:23:57:08","Sure. Okay."
"James Somerton","00:23:57:12","00:24:03:07","But it's, it's, it's like gone viral because like, people are just like, this is going to happen. This is going to happen. And then the horrible."
"Nick Herrgott","00:24:03:07","00:24:08:08","Thing is that that happened before any of this was under discussion in the Supreme Court."
"James Somerton","00:24:09:00","00:24:29:03","Oh, yeah. And like everybody knew everybody knew it was going to happen. And now it is. And, you know, it's it is happening. This is it is honestly, to me, I think. And, you know, it's horrible that this happened with the Supreme Court. I hate that America is going through such a shitstorm right now, especially after like the Obama years where it seemed like things were getting better."
"Nick Herrgott","00:24:29:03","00:24:31:01","Americans deserve better than America."
"James Somerton","00:24:31:04","00:24:46:04","They did. I tweeted something close to that, but that it's like all you gays. And we're like, fuck the trans is fuck trans people, fuck trans people, nonbinary people, fuck them. Fucking fuck them. Yeah. How'd the Supreme Court take down?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:24:46:05","00:24:46:14","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:24:46:22","00:24:51:10","They took down you. They? Yeah. Like, yeah, the hate. The trans cases haven't come yet."
"Nick Herrgott","00:24:51:15","00:24:57:15","Hmm. Yours did. But this was always going to happen. Yeah, this was all we put out. A video of several."
"Speaker 2","00:24:57:23","00:24:59:12","Multiple one of you."
"Nick Herrgott","00:24:59:12","00:25:07:13","All complaining that we're too negative lately. It's like we were kind of. We're too homophobic. One homosexual man in a person, vaguely."
"Speaker 2","00:25:08:18","00:25:09:08","In a vague."
"James Somerton","00:25:09:08","00:25:10:18","And a vague and insane shape."
"Speaker 2","00:25:11:13","00:25:11:18","Of a."
"Nick Herrgott","00:25:11:18","00:25:12:10","Person."
"Speaker 2","00:25:12:17","00:25:13:06","We're having a."
"Nick Herrgott","00:25:13:06","00:25:14:19","Mental breakdown from over here."
"Speaker 2","00:25:14:19","00:25:18:06","Being like, just like both."
"Nick Herrgott","00:25:18:06","00:25:36:00","Of us. So much of our dreams are kind of wrapped up in this vague idea of America. Like you have your Hollywood, Hollywood. It's impossible to publish in Canada. So of course I want to be tethered to America because that's where a large audiences and yeah, you know, like, you know, Marina Diamandis once said, I'm obsessed with the mess that's America."
"Nick Herrgott","00:25:37:06","00:25:55:09","I don't I feel bad. And, you know, once again, followers chime in because I really don't know. I've kind of gotten a little bit of terrified out of her. Mm. I don't know. I don't want to assume that about her because she's been such a sweetheart for the rest of her career. But yeah, whenever more recent albums, there were a few lyrics in there and I was like, Mm hmm."
"Nick Herrgott","00:25:55:09","00:26:00:23","Like, and I can see, like, there is a way you could be coming from this that is supportive, but this also could be a dog whistle."
"James Somerton","00:26:01:00","00:26:03:11","Well, it's always it's always you never know."
"Nick Herrgott","00:26:03:18","00:26:06:18","And I want to give her the benefit of the doubt. That's the thing. Because I think that well."
"James Somerton","00:26:06:18","00:26:17:17","That's that's kind of what happened with Bette Midler is Bette Midler said some terrific stuff and a lot of people were like, you know, canceled. But oddly, a lot of trans people were like, give her a minute."
"Nick Herrgott","00:26:17:17","00:26:18:02","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:26:18:10","00:26:21:07","And then she immediately came out was like, well, I'm a fucking idiot, really?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:26:21:10","00:26:28:23","Because Bette Midler has a history of, like, being a loud mouth. Yeah. Like saying things before she really realizes it and then realizing, Oh, well, I have been correct."
"James Somerton","00:26:28:23","00:26:43:19","And as far as I know, she's corrective incorrect. She has really reversed everything that she said before Hocus Pocus two came out. She didn't say anything like Rowling ask anything like that. It was just like it was like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:26:44:10","00:26:53:03","But it's one of those things. Phrasing. Yeah, it's one of those things like there needs to be a specific word for this. Aside from dog whistling, it's like, I could read this either way in this person, I don't know."
"Speaker 2","00:26:53:03","00:26:53:16","Like, yeah."
"James Somerton","00:26:53:20","00:27:06:13","And it's like, you know, Bette Midler is and has been an ally for a very long time. And it is so, you know, it's figuring out like who's being malicious and who's just who's being so flippant."
"Nick Herrgott","00:27:06:13","00:27:10:01","Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, you and I are both very flippant people."
"James Somerton","00:27:10:04","00:27:17:17","Yeah. And I've said things on stream and people in the chat are immediately like, James, you want to take that back?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:27:18:18","00:27:20:06","I been there for that."
"James Somerton","00:27:20:06","00:27:28:04","So it's nothing like super duper offensive. It's mostly just like, like, like just talking too much."
"Speaker 2","00:27:28:08","00:27:28:17","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:27:29:06","00:27:41:10","So like, like I saying, I was like, what the Mrs. America like, so, like, I a multiple of my book ideas take place in America and like, I don't really know how to respond to that with America kind of falling apart the way that it is."
"James Somerton","00:27:41:11","00:27:41:17","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:27:42:02","00:27:44:18","Um, aside from just, you know, keep checking on."
"James Somerton","00:27:45:08","00:28:07:01","Well, yeah. And, you know, it's with Nimona in it, it's oddly timely because, you know, it's this story of a large group of people just looking for something to be afraid of. Yeah. And the power structure saying, let's give you something to be afraid of. Because if you're afraid, it's so much easier for."
"Nick Herrgott","00:28:07:01","00:28:18:17","Us to not control. But she kind of becomes the monster that they accuse her of. Yeah, because she's just pushed into that territory like there's nothing else to do, which is actually kind of a theme of the next novel in my book."
"Speaker 2","00:28:18:17","00:28:20:18","But it's the next couple."
"James Somerton","00:28:21:23","00:28:29:05","And I do have to say Chloe Grace Moretz, who voiced Nimona. Yeah, Yeah. You know. 30 Rock alum."
"Nick Herrgott","00:28:29:17","00:28:40:07","Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, she was the queen of fortune for a brief time, so there was contention between her and Boxy. And then I couldn't really I didn't stick around for Jane for long enough to figure out who won that I've."
"James Somerton","00:28:40:07","00:28:56:05","Never been on Fortune. It's but she did she did such a good job with the voice work. Everyone did it. I was I was really shocked when I was going through the credits because I didn't I didn't realize it was Eugene from the dry guys. First of all, I was like, Oh, he can be really good voice actor."
"Nick Herrgott","00:28:57:12","00:29:01:22","Well, I kind of felt he was the weaker of the collection. There were a few line deliveries."
"James Somerton","00:29:02:05","00:29:15:19","And the thing is, like, I've watched a lot of try guys videos. It didn't, it wasn't him. Yeah, like it wasn't his personality. RuPaul and and Indya Moore have voiced cameos as news broadcasters. I was like, Wow, they cleared the hell out of this."
"Nick Herrgott","00:29:15:19","00:29:28:14","Yeah. And so, like, they weren't trying to make it ambiguous. They were doing, you know, queer in front of and behind the camera. They were doing allegory. This was allegorical trans representation. Okay, good. We got this. Let's not keep going with allegory."
"James Somerton","00:29:29:06","00:29:37:09","Yeah, actual right. It's like, okay, there is an allegorical trans representation. We're not going to do allegorical gay representation. So boys kissing."
"Nick Herrgott","00:29:37:09","00:29:39:00","Yeah, we don't need that anymore."
"James Somerton","00:29:39:00","00:29:51:09","Like, it's like, Come on, come on. It's 20, 23. Jesus Christ. Yeah. And it was just really shocking. Like, there's been so much good animation this year with Puss in Boots and Spider-Man."
"Nick Herrgott","00:29:51:10","00:29:53:10","An American animation renaissance."
"James Somerton","00:29:53:11","00:29:58:22","Like, I think animation American animation is finally saying, we don't have to just be for."
"Nick Herrgott","00:29:58:22","00:29:59:09","Kids."
"James Somerton","00:30:00:01","00:30:17:03","And, you know, there's always been American animation that's done that Ralph Bakshi and stuff like that. But it's always kind of been like South Park adjacent where it's like it's not just for kids, but kids can't watch it now. It's kind of all ages means, yeah, your ten year old can watch it and you 40 year olds can watch it and enjoy it."
"Nick Herrgott","00:30:17:03","00:30:23:08","So very mature for a kid show to like it. Oh, yeah. Access it Like it's like we say about Star Wars. It's kid accessible."
"James Somerton","00:30:23:08","00:30:26:11","Yeah. Like there was a little bit of blood. Not much. There was a spurt that was it."
"Nick Herrgott","00:30:27:05","00:30:28:22","Was a juice box."
"James Somerton","00:30:30:07","00:30:50:11","No, no. When when she got hit, right? When she took the arrow to the knee, there was like he pulled it out a little and spurted and. Yeah. But there was like there was some violence. There was, you know, there was no cursing, no, there was no nothing sexual. Almost cursing almost at the very end. Yeah, there was nothing sexual."
"James Somerton","00:30:50:11","00:30:55:12","The closest thing to sex was a leg, a quick peck between the two guys at the very end."
"Nick Herrgott","00:30:56:11","00:31:00:13","And a lot of very strong sexual tension. Sexual tension?"
"Speaker 2","00:31:00:13","00:31:01:19","Continued tension."
"James Somerton","00:31:01:19","00:31:02:03","Yes."
"Nick Herrgott","00:31:02:16","00:31:09:00","Oh, I. Yeah, I understand why they brought them back together at the end, but I'm still like, I wouldn't know if I. If."
"James Somerton","00:31:09:17","00:31:15:12","If I had my extra half hour, I would have had like the sort of Daniel Marshall where he's like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:31:15:13","00:31:17:02","There's a lot of broken trust."
"James Somerton","00:31:17:02","00:31:20:14","Hi. Can I come in? No, just like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:31:20:18","00:31:22:01","We're not. We're not there."
"James Somerton","00:31:22:01","00:31:31:04","Yet. Like, Yeah, like make him kind of earn his way back in. And, like, he was hot, though, so I get it. But at the same time, I'm like, he was."
"Nick Herrgott","00:31:31:04","00:31:49:00","Hot, but privileged and like. Like very pretty. But that's the thing that this, this also didn't explore in a way that I wish I wish if it was longer than it could have, because they could have explored that wealth dichotomy. Because I've heard this. Yes, I brought this up before, but I've heard from multiple people, poor people being like, Yeah, I dated a rich guy once."
"Nick Herrgott","00:31:49:00","00:31:54:20","He asked what my favorite cheese was. I didn't know what to answer. I said cheddar, and he looked egregiously offended."
"James Somerton","00:31:55:21","00:31:59:13","I was going to say brioche. That's not cheese, that's bread. But like."
"Nick Herrgott","00:31:59:13","00:32:01:14","Like that Brie."
"James Somerton","00:32:01:14","00:32:02:03","Is cheese."
"Nick Herrgott","00:32:02:03","00:32:03:00","Though. He is."
"James Somerton","00:32:03:02","00:32:03:19","I don't like it."
"Nick Herrgott","00:32:05:08","00:32:12:15","So, like. Like that kind of dichotomy. Like, I kind of I talked about this in the tragedy being rich. Yeah. The idea of like."
"James Somerton","00:32:12:15","00:32:17:05","Which is the young Royals video Young Royals season three has just wrapped so watch tragedy of being right."
"Nick Herrgott","00:32:17:05","00:32:33:14","There. There is like this compulsive incompatibility between rich and poor people that there needs to be a lot of work to get over. Yeah. In a way that rich people just do fundamentally do not understand how poor people function or how you can function any other way."
"James Somerton","00:32:33:17","00:33:02:09","And there's also, you know, there is also from the poor perspective, I think for a lot of people, you know, for a lot of poor people, it's like I got I can have a rich boyfriend, fuck, yes. But a lot of people who have like dated someone who has money, huge inadequacy. Yeah. Like I've talked to people who they they think I'm, like, super rich because I have a semi-successful YouTube channel and they find out I have like, they see my YouTube channel and they see like, wow, 300,000 subscribers."
"James Somerton","00:33:02:15","00:33:15:19","They immediately think I'm like, fucking Jenna marbles over here. Yeah, yeah. And it get they get quiet and it seems like there's a power imbalance and I'm like, I, it's, I probably make less money than you do."
"Speaker 2","00:33:16:01","00:33:17:13","Yeah. Like so."
"Nick Herrgott","00:33:18:04","00:33:18:12","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:33:18:12","00:33:20:03","And power imbalance isn't there."
"Speaker 2","00:33:20:13","00:33:20:16","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:33:21:02","00:33:29:15","Um, so that wasn't in there and that was, it was hinted. But again, like another reason, like if you were going to explore the reason why they would separate."
"James Somerton","00:33:29:18","00:33:44:04","I think they were kind of like we are. I feel like the thought process was probably like we've got gay nights and we've got a trans or gender queer allegory. Let's not muddle that down with economic issues. Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:33:45:05","00:33:47:06","Because it was kind of fun. Like with the mistrust of."
"James Somerton","00:33:47:06","00:34:11:00","The past, it was trust touched on. But like, I think that's something they could do in a sequel because it's like, okay, you know, these characters are queer now you get it. You know, this character can switch genders and I can do anything that they want. So we can deal with something that like, okay, the basically the church is gone now, but there's still a very ingrained mistrust."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:11:00","00:34:11:19","Of the poor."
"James Somerton","00:34:11:20","00:34:14:04","Yeah. And like that could be very good sequel."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:14:04","00:34:14:15","Fodder."
"James Somerton","00:34:15:16","00:34:24:18","Because it's like, you know, what kind of monster grows out of, you know, that kind of. Yeah. Hatred toward the someone lesser than you. Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:25:10","00:34:25:19","One thing I."
"James Somerton","00:34:25:19","00:34:28:19","Did, the allegorical monster being worse than the actual monster kind."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:28:19","00:34:42:05","Of thing. One thing I wish there was more because there was this one we touched on briefly was planting mistrust of everyone when it was kind of revealed that What's her name? Not Loretta. Loretta No. Shapeshifter girl."
"James Somerton","00:34:42:17","00:34:43:05","Nimona."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:43:06","00:34:43:19","Nimona."
"James Somerton","00:34:44:00","00:34:44:15","It's the movie."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:45:02","00:34:57:19","Name. I know. I completely blanked when it kind of found out that she can. She's a shape shifter. She started to be like, Oh, she could be anyone. And then, like, you know, you saw people being mistrustful of each other, backing."
"James Somerton","00:34:57:19","00:34:58:12","Away from their friends."
"Nick Herrgott","00:34:58:13","00:35:04:21","I would like I would have liked to see more of that. Maybe a specific reference to being mistrusting someone inside the public bathroom."
"Speaker 2","00:35:04:21","00:35:05:17","Like, yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:35:06:16","00:35:09:02","Kind of getting a little bit deeper into that."
"James Somerton","00:35:09:02","00:35:12:15","I mean, I can understand why they wouldn't want to deal with the bathroom thing specifically."
"Nick Herrgott","00:35:12:18","00:35:16:16","Yeah, but like having this kind of more specific interests, but like, oh, anyone could be trans."
"James Somerton","00:35:16:22","00:35:21:01","And again, that's why I'm like, you know, an extra 20 to an extra 20 or 30 minutes into the movie. Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:35:21:08","00:35:27:01","But they were expensive at that point. They were actually running low on time. That was coming. That was at the beginning of the third act."
"James Somerton","00:35:27:02","00:35:28:17","Yeah, I like that kind of so they."
"Nick Herrgott","00:35:28:17","00:35:30:13","Had to get this ball rolling."
"James Somerton","00:35:30:17","00:35:44:04","And keeping in mind as well, like length, like I'm like, Oh, they should have done another half hour. They were abandoned by Disney and left to fend for themselves with an independent production company. They so they probably didn't have a ton of money in animation as."
"Nick Herrgott","00:35:44:04","00:35:50:03","Expected, like all of these gaps, I guess. And I'm willing to forgive it's for for this reason because it didn't really feel like the movie was missing anything."
"James Somerton","00:35:50:05","00:35:53:18","No, it wasn't missing exactly. It didn't feel like it was missing anything."
"Nick Herrgott","00:35:54:01","00:36:00:18","But I'm just pointing out things that they kind of put their toe into a little bit so they could have expanded if they wanted to."
"James Somerton","00:36:00:18","00:36:18:04","Yeah. And I'm kind of looking at it as like, everybody go watch it. So we got a sequel. Yeah, right. So that the sequel can kind of expand upon this because I would like Riz Ahmed to have more work. He's a very talented actor and he doesn't get paid. He doesn't get working off because he's brown resume and he was in."
"Speaker 2","00:36:20:06","00:36:20:17","Whole."
"James Somerton","00:36:21:00","00:36:30:15","Shit. I forget the movie's name. He was in Rogue One. He was in I forget the name of the movie. I think he got an Oscar nomination for it. Oh, he's."
"Nick Herrgott","00:36:30:15","00:36:37:05","Cute. Yeah, he wasn't Rogue one. I have heard, like, Oscar buzz for him. Oh, it seems like he got an Oscar."
"James Somerton","00:36:37:23","00:36:45:19","Oh. Oh, he did win an Oscar. Yeah. Yeah, that was. I forget what that was for, I think. I think that was for the Jake Gyllenhaal movie."
"Nick Herrgott","00:36:46:10","00:36:49:19","Yeah, Maybe. I mean, Academy Award winner resume ADD. Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:36:50:23","00:36:56:23","And for. Oh, also for people who know who she is. Frances Conroy. Also, she voices a character in this."
"Nick Herrgott","00:36:57:10","00:37:03:10","And the director, right. Um, the blond woman. Yes."
"James Somerton","00:37:03:12","00:37:19:05","Yeah. And Frances Conroy was on Six Feet Under and she was also, you know, famous for being an American horror story. Balenciaga like playing Myrtle Snow and lots of other characters. But she's been, you know, very famous lately for American Horror Story. She's in there. Oh, that's."
"Nick Herrgott","00:37:19:05","00:37:21:10","Her. I know when I know who Myrtle is."
"Speaker 2","00:37:21:16","00:37:22:00","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:37:22:20","00:37:34:15","So it's like it's a super queer, inclusive cast. And even the characters that aren't played or played by queer people are played by, like, dyed in the Wool allies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's just it's so refreshing."
"Speaker 2","00:37:34:19","00:37:35:23","To see a movie."
"James Somerton","00:37:36:06","00:37:53:16","Where there's, like, no caveats. There's no the animators were put through hell. There's no, the main actors are shit head. There's no the director sexually assaulted someone, right. There's none of it. It's just like I can just enjoy this. And not only can I just enjoy it, it's gay."
"Nick Herrgott","00:37:53:16","00:38:04:14","Yeah, it's. I was, like, surprised. Like I said, first 5 minutes after the introduction, kind of like Prolog. Like, it's like, Oh, they're there. Oh, they're getting close. Oh, hands are touching. Oh, they're leaning."
"James Somerton","00:38:04:20","00:38:05:21","Yeah. Guys like other lean."
"Speaker 2","00:38:06:04","00:38:08:18","Oh, got his head is on his shoulder and."
"James Somerton","00:38:09:09","00:38:17:13","I'm like, oh my God. They went there and then when they actually had the kiss at the end, I was like, oh they, they beat the urine ice curse. Yeah. Like they, they, they stepped."
"Speaker 2","00:38:17:13","00:38:18:17","Over the line. They do this."
"Nick Herrgott","00:38:20:05","00:38:24:20","I'm not going to lie like, especially because from being on some streams and people being like, your voice is."
"James Somerton","00:38:24:20","00:38:26:16","So, oh I have no problem with your."
"Nick Herrgott","00:38:26:18","00:38:35:21","On. And that's what I mean. Like I want more like urine I swear it's like abundantly apparent, but it's like, you know, never quote unquote confirmed and like yes I want to."
"Speaker 2","00:38:36:11","00:38:36:18","Just."
"James Somerton","00:38:37:10","00:38:52:03","I that's just like my but you're on ice is my like it's obvious but you know, they just stayed behind that one line and I know why because of censorship laws and all that sort of stuff. Not censorship laws. It's the advertising."
"Nick Herrgott","00:38:52:12","00:38:55:15","Well, yeah, not even that. But like, I will push back against that being like."
"James Somerton","00:38:55:16","00:39:00:02","No, it's fine. It's not about it's not about the relationship. It's about you're is kind of just that."
"Nick Herrgott","00:39:00:02","00:39:04:05","But I think it's still qualifying to believe that even if there isn't any kissing because."
"James Somerton","00:39:04:05","00:39:06:04","If anyone says you're on ice and gay as fuck, they're."
"Nick Herrgott","00:39:06:04","00:39:13:04","Not. Yeah, because like guys like, you know, asexual people exist and sometimes they don't like kissing and that doesn't mean they don't like being romantic."
"James Somerton","00:39:13:04","00:39:34:05","And I actually getting very off topic, but I actually really like the fact that there's a lot of people online who are like, you're on the spectrum. Like Yuri is like madly in love with Viktor, but like, you know, Viktor and and Kristoff Kristoff jump in bed with them. And his first thought is your, your, your feet are cold."
"James Somerton","00:39:34:13","00:39:39:15","So it's like that is not, you know, horny, horny 20 year old. Yeah. Activity."
"Speaker 2","00:39:39:16","00:39:40:01","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:39:41:11","00:39:59:03","I like and that's okay. Like you don't and that's what I like like you say about lots of things that doesn't indie dicks and that's for it to qualify as gay like yeah if we're trying to present queer experiences, then we need to. Brod I hate saying that because like, we need to broaden our definition of what qualifies as queer experience because then we get more of this allegorical bullshit."
"James Somerton","00:39:59:10","00:40:10:14","With Nimona, we don't get the allegorical with, with trans and non-binary gender queer kind of stuff. We there is a bit of an allegory there, but with the gay stuff, it is right there."
"Nick Herrgott","00:40:10:14","00:40:14:23","Yeah. Because I don't dislike allegory and I think that it's useful and I don't. I hate."
"James Somerton","00:40:14:23","00:40:16:04","That you're not talking."
"Nick Herrgott","00:40:16:13","00:40:29:06","Right. Like I like seeing allegory. But at the same time, I also don't think that I think that hiding behind allegory is bad. So, yes, we got Nimona, it's very trans and gender nonbinary, non-conforming, and."
"James Somerton","00:40:29:06","00:40:32:03","Like Indya Moore, who is not gender."
"Speaker 2","00:40:32:03","00:40:32:16","Queer."
"Nick Herrgott","00:40:32:18","00:40:34:03","Or I think gender."
"James Somerton","00:40:34:03","00:40:36:19","Or non-binary gender fluid."
"Nick Herrgott","00:40:36:19","00:40:39:23","I think I think nonbinary non-binary is the umbrella definition."
"James Somerton","00:40:40:08","00:40:40:17","Okay."
"Nick Herrgott","00:40:42:05","00:40:44:00","I was hearing fireworks in the background."
"James Somerton","00:40:44:01","00:40:45:03","Because it's Canada."
"Speaker 2","00:40:45:03","00:40:45:23","Today."
"James Somerton","00:40:46:09","00:40:48:02","Um, we haven't left the house."
"Nick Herrgott","00:40:48:09","00:40:50:06","We haven't. It was raining for most of today."
"James Somerton","00:40:50:07","00:41:05:11","Yeah. Nick slept over last night so that we could do movie stuff. We did. We have there's going to be a video coming out in a couple of days, kind of talking about some Tello stuff. So look forward to that. So it's going to come out for for patrons as well. It's not like a video essay or anything."
"James Somerton","00:41:05:11","00:41:05:19","It's just some."
"Nick Herrgott","00:41:05:19","00:41:30:14","Explanations. So we're talking about, yeah, like allegories. So like we got Nimona and it's great, but we shouldn't keep hiding behind this because one thing that happens with these allegorical representations and I've had to take some people close to me to task for this, is it gets into the cycle of No, it was about like monsters. It was about like, you know, it wasn't specifically oh sure, non-binary people can be included, but this movie was about weirdos in general and."
"James Somerton","00:41:30:14","00:41:37:21","Even with like there was so much like, I can see how you could see this is a gay experience, but it's really just about Monster boys."
"Nick Herrgott","00:41:37:21","00:41:38:13","It's like it's a."
"James Somerton","00:41:38:17","00:41:40:02","Bunch of little queer."
"Speaker 2","00:41:40:21","00:41:41:21","A little weird."
"Nick Herrgott","00:41:43:07","00:41:44:18","They're trying to hide their colors."
"Speaker 2","00:41:45:04","00:41:46:06","Like, ah, Dahmer."
"James Somerton","00:41:49:00","00:41:58:04","But like right now with Nimona, like, I hope it takes off because it was, like, so much fun. But like, even on Rotten Tomatoes, it's got a 94% right."
"Nick Herrgott","00:41:58:04","00:41:59:20","Now for animations. That's weird."
"Speaker 2","00:42:00:02","00:42:01:12","And it's even."
"James Somerton","00:42:01:19","00:42:04:01","It's 94% among critics and."
"Speaker 2","00:42:04:01","00:42:05:14","Audiences. That never."
"Nick Herrgott","00:42:05:14","00:42:06:00","Happens."
"James Somerton","00:42:06:16","00:42:31:08","Like it is such a fun and just like especially with all the stuff that's going on, all the crap that's going on for queer people all over the goddamn globe. Yeah, that there is this animated movie on Netflix that you can watch and just enjoy is like, and I want to give a shout out to the show Glamorous, which is also also just came out on Netflix, which is another extremely queer thing on Netflix."
"Nick Herrgott","00:42:31:09","00:42:32:13","Making up for Dave Chappelle."
"James Somerton","00:42:33:10","00:42:45:16","Right that you can just watch and enjoy. And like most of the cast of Glamorous are people of color. Like it's like Kim. I think I think Kim Cattrall is like the only like white person in the cast."
"Nick Herrgott","00:42:45:16","00:42:47:12","And, you know, we we kind of stand her."
"James Somerton","00:42:47:21","00:43:07:02","Oh, yeah. Like she can she can do whatever she wants and like, yeah, Netflix is kind of making up for lost time, but it's like advertising is things like glamorous. They get quite a bit of advertising. It looks like there's probably going to be a season two. It's done quite well, but like I haven't seen maybe it's maybe, you know, in like animation circles and stuff."
"James Somerton","00:43:07:02","00:43:10:04","Nimona is like very well known, but like took."
"Nick Herrgott","00:43:10:04","00:43:13:12","The first Spider-Verse movie a little bit to kind of get word of mouth out there."
"James Somerton","00:43:13:17","00:43:30:00","Yeah. And like, I wouldn't expect like, oh, in a month or two in a month, they're going to announce a sequel. Like with movies, you can take more time than with TV shows because scheduling for a movie is much different, especially for animation, because you can be like, Oh, resume AD can only come in on this week and Chloe Grace Moretz can only come in and this week it doesn't matter."
"James Somerton","00:43:30:00","00:43:34:21","They're they're not acting together, they're in a booth, you know, it's just animators."
"Nick Herrgott","00:43:34:21","00:43:35:03","And yeah."
"James Somerton","00:43:35:03","00:43:53:05","Yeah. So far nothing has come out saying that the animators were like, tortured, tortured and, you know, put on the rack and stuff. So, you know, that's nice because everything else, apparently the animators are just treated like shit. Yeah, it's like, Oh my God, the animators need a union."
"Nick Herrgott","00:43:53:18","00:43:55:03","So many things and the union."
"James Somerton","00:43:55:22","00:44:02:13","YouTubers need a union. But yeah, it is. It was surprisingly good. I was very."
"Nick Herrgott","00:44:02:20","00:44:10:03","Very I went in with high expectations because of the Rotten Tomatoes score, I'll be honest like, and you know, my expectations were met."
"James Somerton","00:44:10:06","00:44:35:01","I kind of went in thinking like, okay, it's a kid's movie and expecting a good kid's movie. So I was a little shocked at how it it didn't like break out of the mold. It's not like it's not a kid's movie. Yeah, but it's stretched. It's yeah, it's like it is still perfectly fine for kids to watch and really good for them."
"James Somerton","00:44:35:10","00:44:36:15","There's really good message. And it took."
"Nick Herrgott","00:44:36:15","00:44:42:14","A run up to the Shrek franchise and spin offs as far as violence went, it was a little bit more violent. Graphically, it was."
"James Somerton","00:44:42:20","00:44:44:15","Closer to Puss in Boots."
"Nick Herrgott","00:44:44:15","00:44:45:02","Yes."
"James Somerton","00:44:45:02","00:44:45:18","Than Shrek."
"Nick Herrgott","00:44:45:18","00:44:54:18","I think it really went even. It was either the good puss targeting Puss in Boots, because Puss in Boots didn't show much violence against like, people. Yeah. Villains."
"James Somerton","00:44:54:20","00:44:55:05","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:44:55:18","00:44:58:22","But this was very much like, you know, like we're bastions and skulls."
"James Somerton","00:44:59:01","00:44:59:10","Yeah."
"Nick Herrgott","00:44:59:11","00:45:00:09","Violence."
"James Somerton","00:45:00:15","00:45:09:12","Like stabbing people. Yeah. And stuff like that Caused quite a bit of people got run through with swords, actually. Yeah, But, you know, just the one spurted blood."
"Speaker 2","00:45:09:20","00:45:10:01","Yeah."
"James Somerton","00:45:10:16","00:45:12:07","But yeah, like if you had it was."
"Nick Herrgott","00:45:12:07","00:45:14:06","Off screen and it wasn't from a wound."
"James Somerton","00:45:14:17","00:45:16:23","Well it was from a wound you just didn't see coming out of that."
"Nick Herrgott","00:45:16:23","00:45:20:11","That's what I mean. Like that the, the visuals didn't show it coming from a movie."
"James Somerton","00:45:20:11","00:45:28:00","And another thing I've got to say is the visuals for Pneumonias Face had me in stitches multiple times throughout the movie."
"Nick Herrgott","00:45:28:00","00:45:30:12","So much good visual comedy for that."
"James Somerton","00:45:30:12","00:45:33:03","Yeah. And Chloe Grace Moretz again, did a fantastic job."
"Nick Herrgott","00:45:33:05","00:45:35:11","Everyone did needs to get more work."
"James Somerton","00:45:35:13","00:45:54:15","She does. She keeps doing movies that aren't successful and people blame it on her. And she's like, I'm like, it's not her fault that the Carrie remake didn't do well. But yeah, you should definitely check it out. Like if you like animation, if you like gay stuff, queer stuff, you should definitely check it out. It is absolutely worth watching."
"James Somerton","00:45:54:22","00:46:09:03","I Think it was a great movie to start this new podcast Podcast's podcast off with. This'll be the podcast will be coming out on July 5th because there's no point in releasing it before on July 4th weekend. Y'all are."
"Speaker 2","00:46:09:03","00:46:09:15","Busy."
"James Somerton","00:46:10:23","00:46:23:04","So this will be coming out July 5th. We're recording it on the first, so there'll be another one next week and we're going to keep doing this because we got a lot of movies to get through and I think this is a great way to start it off."
"Nick Herrgott","00:46:23:04","00:46:25:05","It was fun. I liked this one and."
"James Somerton","00:46:25:05","00:46:27:03","We got to avoid watching Hamilton."
"Nick Herrgott","00:46:27:04","00:46:29:05","We got to avoid watching him."
"James Somerton","00:46:29:06","00:46:32:03","We were going to watch and compare the producers and Hamilton the."
"Nick Herrgott","00:46:32:03","00:46:35:16","Producers movie, the 2005 or five remake."
"James Somerton","00:46:35:21","00:46:40:03","And and I just started this last night. That was a good idea."
"Nick Herrgott","00:46:40:04","00:46:51:09","We've been dreading it. We did not want to watch Hamilton. I want to I don't want to watch. I really don't want to watch Hamilton."
"James Somerton","00:46:51:09","00:46:54:06","It's like when people ask me about the supernatural video. I'm like."
"Speaker 2","00:46:54:11","00:46:55:12","Especially with."
"Nick Herrgott","00:46:55:17","00:47:00:00","The the weird reason I don't want to watch Hannibal, and this is weird Hamilton, but I say."
"James Somerton","00:47:00:01","00:47:00:14","Hannibal."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:00:14","00:47:01:15","Hannibal, I do want to watch."
"James Somerton","00:47:01:15","00:47:02:16","Hannibal. You watched Hannibal."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:03:10","00:47:03:20","Where is."
"James Somerton","00:47:03:20","00:47:04:11","Season four?"
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:04:11","00:47:06:10","Where it's season four? They could just do a movie."
"James Somerton","00:47:07:09","00:47:14:14","Oh, we've talked about we won't get into the details we've talked about on stream and stuff, but trans Clarice. Trans Clarice. That's how you do The Silence of the Lambs story."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:15:05","00:47:22:05","Um, so like, I didn't want to watch Hamilton because, like, out of all of the royals in the world."
"Speaker 2","00:47:22:19","00:47:26:18","What But correct, you out."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:26:18","00:47:43:15","Of all the royals in the world, I actually have the most respect for King George. I don't remember it. I think it's King George the fifth. Something that specific King George, because I'm like, he struggled a lot with mental health. Yeah. And probably neurodivergent. And he stayed alive in spite of it, which."
"James Somerton","00:47:43:15","00:47:46:14","Is being dealt with on the Netflix show. Queen Charlotte."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:46:15","00:47:49:01","Which I've heard is actually really, really good. My mom, like my."
"James Somerton","00:47:49:01","00:47:51:23","Mom brilliant, has been telling me to watch it, but I need to get through glamorous."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:51:23","00:47:56:12","First. My mom liked Queen Charlotte, the mini series way better than George Bridgerton. She said she."
"James Somerton","00:47:56:15","00:47:59:15","Has no interest in Bridgerton, but I am interested in Queen Charlotte."
"Nick Herrgott","00:47:59:18","00:48:07:00","Tonight. I watched in for a bit of Queen Charlotte and I was like, I know it's going. I like, I like what's going on there. So yeah, quick. King George, I'm a big."
"James Somerton","00:48:07:00","00:48:15:15","Fan actor who plays King George in Queen Charlotte is also openly gay and he's playing a straight lead. Yeah, and I'm a romantic straight lead. And I'm like, Oh, boy, God, Go."
"Nick Herrgott","00:48:15:16","00:48:34:20","Yeah, go off. So like, yeah. King George dealt with a lot of mental health problems when he got to a point in his career where he couldn't continue doing public appearances, he went and actually managed the kingdom. Yeah. And fought for a lot of, you know, humanitarian rights and stuff and the rhetoric. And he was toasted well into the American Revolution by the."
"James Somerton","00:48:34:20","00:48:36:15","By the by the by the founding."
"Nick Herrgott","00:48:36:20","00:49:00:02","Fathers. Their beef was with English parliament, not the crown. Yeah, but when they started realizing we're not going to win this, they turned to a propaganda smear campaign and turned him into the mad King. Yeah. So he was not the villain of this story. And like, Hamilton kind of just represents to me this, kind of archetypical American fix for propaganda is let's replace the existing propaganda with other different propaganda."
"Nick Herrgott","00:49:00:02","00:49:00:23","That's also not true."
"James Somerton","00:49:00:23","00:49:13:02","Yeah, let's literally anyway change the Constitution. No, we'll not change the costumes, but yeah. So yeah. Thank you guys so much for listening. I hope you enjoyed it. Please leave comments in the wherever you want to leave."
"Nick Herrgott","00:49:13:06","00:49:16:13","Where they get read for Phil, for for having, you know, an inkling of support for King George."
"Speaker 2","00:49:16:14","00:49:17:03","Oh, probably."
"James Somerton","00:49:19:04","00:49:31:12","I hope you all had a wonderful 4th of July weekend. And I hope you have a wonderful coming week. And we'll be back. We actually will be back with another episode because now Nick is within driving distance and."
"Nick Herrgott","00:49:31:12","00:49:34:01","We have a format, too, because it was so hard to come up with podcast."
"James Somerton","00:49:34:02","00:49:35:10","Oh, God, it was so. And I."
"Nick Herrgott","00:49:35:10","00:49:37:10","Mean, I'll talk about anything for our ends."

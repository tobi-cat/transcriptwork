Escoffier states that “these three movies [Deep Throat, The Devil in Miss Jones, and Behind the Green Door] earned more...than all but a handful of mainstream Hollywood releases.” The reference to the Godfather in the original text is to compare the state of general filmmaking to the porn industry.

<comment {% include commenter for= tobi %}>

James changes it to four movies in order to include *Boys in the Sand* - this is inaccurate, [as *Boys in the Sand* only made $140,000 in the first six months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_in_the_Sand), while the other three films each made over $10 million in domestic rentals (the amount the studio gets after theaters take their cut), though exact numbers are inconsistent and hard to find from this time period. [*The Godfather* made much more than any of these movies, at over $80 million in domestic rentals(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather#Reception)], and it was the top grossing film of 1972.

The "financed by the mafia" bit is true, though.

<mark>Though the sexual revolution</mark> that made these films possible <mark>was at first a mostly heterosexual affair, it also had a profound effect on gay men. The intense stigma attached to homosexuality before Stonewall blocked any open discussion of gay male sexuality and forced gay men's sexual expression deep underground. Consequently, the increasing acceptance of pornography during the 60s and 70s played a significant role in the sexual lives of gay men, even more than it did among the straight men of the same age. The increasing social acceptance of porn helped to legitimize visual representations of homoerotic images and gay sex in general. Before 1962, homosexual materials, even those without any sexual content, were considered obscene by definition</mark> in the US and much of Europe. <mark>The emergence of gay hardcore films provided explicit representations of gay sexual behavior not otherwise available. And the availability of such images helped to affirm the nascent gay identity.</mark>

<mark>Since most gay men become adults without learning the social and sexual codes of their community, porn contributes, as film critic Richard Dyer has observed, to their education of desire. Erections, orgasms, and the performances of sexually desirable, masculine, and energetic performers helped to create positive images of what gay men could be</mark> instead of the wholly negative images portrayed in mainstream culture. 

Gay porn produced soon after Stonewall focused heavily on masculine men since the culturally accepted image of a gay man was that of the sissy from Hollywood movies. The artwork of Touko Vallo Laaksonen, better known as Tom of Finland, helped to create the image of the hypermasculine gay man that permeated gay culture in the 1970s, and gay porn movies sought to emulate these ideals with the men they cast. While it's by no means representative of the entire gay community, these masculine stars showed gay men both young and old that they could be more than just hairdressers. Not that there's anything wrong with that. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we really ought to be appreciating our hairdressers a lot more. But these porn stars were plumbers, carpenters, cops, firefighters, bikers, and construction workers, the type of men that gay men desired to be and desired to have.

<mark>Since most gay men become adults without learning the social and sexual codes of their community, film pornography contributes, as film critic Richard Dyer has observed, to their "education of desire." Erections, orgasms, and the performances of sexually desirable, masculine, and energetic performers helped to create positive images of gay male sexuality and identity.</mark> Gay hardcore also reinforced the new style of gay masculinity - it recorded (almost like a "documentary") and codified the new masculine sexual ethos that was emerging among gay men. Gay porn, as a genre, portrayed "straight" men engaging in homosexual acts. It thus served to situate homosexual desire within masculine territory irrespective of heterosexual or gay identities. The commercial success of gay porn emerged from the cultural and economic significance of gay identities, and not - however widespread it may be among males - homosexual desire.

<mark>Desire, psychologists have found, is not something given to us out of the blue. It is constructed through fantasy - and it is through fantasy that we learn how to desire. Pornographic movies are passports to a fantasy world where sex exists without the everyday encumbrances of social convention, endurance, or availability. To <span stat:id="changed-quote"><<q>imagine a sexual performance in a fantasy or to see one in a porn movie, enables us to experience sexual excitement without the side effects of anxiety, guilt, boredom,</mark> or danger.</q></span> <mark>And for many of us the erotic excitement is heightened when the fantasy includes an element of risk:</mark> sex in public, sex with a stranger, sex without a condom, or sex in front of a salad <u>[clip of the “Right in front of my salad?” meme]</u> <mark>lets us explore these fantasies.</mark> But porn didn't suddenly pop up in the 1970s fully formed and hard as a rock. Porn, even gay porn, has been around for a very long time. Now, I'm not going to get into cave paintings, Egyptian carvings, or Renaissance art, though; this is a YouTube video, not a ten part Netflix documentary. Though, Netflix, if you're watching, call me. So, let's start at the very beginning of modern gay porn. I hear it's a very good place to start.

## Part 1: Beefcake

<compare>
<james span=2 {% include timecode %}>

It's the 1950s, and you're walking down a busy New York street. You stop at a news stand, and hidden amongst the news, cooking, and culture magazines sits one or two issues of a physique magazine. You buy it, the clerk stuffs it into a nondescript brown paper bag, and you rush home. <mark>It started as an underground phenomenon, with small magazines containing photographs of almost nude men being sold by mail and on newsstands in larger cities. These physique magazines and the mail-order business that grew up around them were the primary source of erotic male images for gay men,</mark> receiving the iconic nickname “Beefcake.”

Beefcake

To some degree, the films of Kenneth Anger, Jack Smith, and Andy Warhol took for granted the gay male erotic culture that had begun to emerge in the 1950s. <mark>It started as an underground phenomenon, with small magazines containing photographs of almost nude men being sold on newsstands in the larger cities. These "physique magazines" and the mail-order businesses based upon them were the primary source of erotic male images for gay men.</mark>

<mark>Bob Mizer, an amateur photographer living in Los Angeles, played a major role in developing the business of publishing homoerotic images. At the time</mark>, in post-World War II America, <mark>most photographs of nude men or drawings of erotic scenes were available only through private networks to select mail-order customers. Long aware of his attraction to men, Mizer had taken nude photographs of attractive male friends since he was a teenager and developed the film in a closet set up as a dark room.</mark>

In response, Mizer suggested to the other physique photographers that they pool their mailing lists and send out their catalogues jointly-thus minimizing the Post Office's opportu- nities for harassment. <mark>A couple of years later, when Mizer was experimenting with grouping the pages together, it occurred to him to create a magazine. He decided to call it *Physique Pictorial*. It featured photographs of young men wearing only pos- ing straps, bathing suits, or loincloths and almost no editorial content</mark> - except that is, for the long and deceptively chatty, highly opinionated captions that often functioned implicitly more like editorials.

<mark>Prostitution and nude modeling for artists and photographers have a long shared history.

At the same time, over the years, he had developed an elaborate set of codes to summarize information about each of his models’ temperament, honesty, and physical traits, as well as sexual characteristics and interests. He offered the key to the code to various trusted customers. Nevertheless, the secret code seemed suspicious to the LAPD vice squad, who arrested him for running a prostitution ring.

DeSimone's no-erection S&M wasn't flying with the majority of patrons at gay-porn theaters, either. They were seeing more and more 8mm shorts involving actual sex coming from unnamed parties, and so, simulated sex, kinky or not, wasn't going to cut it.

The shift to hardcore raised another challenge: developing the professional technique and conventions for filming explicit sex acts. The gay soft-core films shown in the Park and other theaters had barely moved beyond frontal nudity and kissing. Some of the physique photographers such as Bruce of L.A. or Bob Mizer had made 8mm hardcore shorts for special customers with oral and anal penetration - but they were not shown in theaters.

</from>
<comment {% include commenter for= tobi %}>

Seems to be the closest match, since both describe 8mm hardcore shorts, but the book says that the shorts were for special customers, so most theater patrons wouldn't have seen them. According to the book, Signature Films, DeSimone's employer, made the switch to hardcore "to compete with the San Francisco and New York exhibitors" (63) and because "audiences in L.A. had also tired of the sentimental and soft-core gay films."

The film would be a riff on the Best Picture-winning *Midnight Cowboy*, and Douglas decided without any hesitation to cast Casey Donovan in the lead. It opened a year later to packed theaters in New York, LA, San Francisco, and Montreal. But because exhibiting porn was a legal gray area at the time, <mark>it was hard for filmmakers to ensure that they were getting their cut, and there was no way of guaranteeing that a theater owner wouldn't simply duplicate the film print, give back the original, and continue to show the movie</mark> without ever having to pay another dime.

Because theaters showing sexually explicit films were not quite legitimate, and since making hardcore films for theatrical release was still a new business, there were few established firms without Mafia ties distributing the movies. <mark>There was no guarantee that the filmmaker would be paid his share of the box office, and there was no way to prevent the theater owner from duplicating the print, returning the original, and continuing to run the film</mark> without the filmmaker's knowledge. Moreover, the wear and tear on the prints meant expensive repairs to them each time they were returned-if they were returned. All contributed to the difficulty and high cost of scheduling features theatrically. With no reliable distribution, producers like Poole and Douglas were at a distinct disadvantage compared to theater owners who produced their own hardcore films.

So, theater owners in New Jersey and San Francisco were shocked when they were visited by members of the New York mafia. Gay-porn producers decided to take a page from the straight-porn book and enlist the help of La Cosa Nostra in ensuring they got paid. This partnership eventually led to gay porn being exhibited in mafia-owned theaters in most major cities, removing the middleman and increasing profits for both producers and their Italian enforcers. While the involvement of the mafia led to many filmmakers leaving the business, Jerry Douglas among them, it gave the world of gay adult cinema a solid bedrock to grow from. Unlike art house theaters, mafia-run cinemas had the money to bribe cops who would have otherwise confiscated prints as obscene artifacts. Gay porn now had creative and innovative filmmakers, nationally famous stars, a growing fan base, and a rock-solid distribution channel. There was nowhere to go but up.

David Brinkley (NBC News Broadcaster): The Supreme Court ruled today that if anyone wants to read dirty books or look at dirty movies in his own home, he may do so, and it's none of the law's business. The law still may regulate the spread of obscenity in public, but the court said a person has every right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home, that the law has no business telling anyone alone at home what books he may read or what films he may look at.

<mark>Travis shot the first movie Falcon made-a two-part loop called *Muscle, Sweat and Brawn*</mark> (Falcon 508, reissued as FVP010), which featured one of the early stars of gay porn, Dean Chasson.

This is false on two levels. The urban legend is that porn in general, not Falcon Studios specifically, using the VHS format led to the death of Betamax. However, it’s more likely that VHS won because it was non-proprietary, cheaper, and had a larger data-storage capacity ([Why VHS was better than Betamax | Jack Schofield | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2003/jan/25/comment.comment), [The Dirty Backstabbing Mess Called Betamax vs VHS (gizmodo.com)](https://gizmodo.com/the-dirty-backstabbing-mess-called-betamax-vs-vhs-5316722), [Porn industry may be decider in Blu-ray, HD-DVD battle | Macworld](https://www.macworld.com/article/179767/pornhd.html)).

It's unclear if *The Other Side of Aspen* even chose VHS over Betamax.

<mark>In an effort to avoid losing their audience with performances that only consisted of safer sex, studios first tried a more didactic approach. Starting in 1987, both Catalina and Falcon Studios put a three-minute instructional trailer produced by Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) on their video tapes.</mark> Catalina also included a note that stated: "Laboratory studies have shown that using a lubricant with a concentration of 4-5% or higher on nonoxynol-9 can kill many viruses and greatly reduce the chance of infection from sexually transmitted diseases." <mark>Even as late as 1988, condoms are evident in only a minority of the gay pornographic movies</mark> released. Most producers of hardcore videos relied on nonoxynol-9 for protection from HIV and other STDs. [Douglas, R.W. Richards, Manshots, 9/88, 23]

Evidence of a class specifically on erotica does not exist in either Yale.

Right, so, as to Stefano's overdose being intentional - yeah, I couldn't find any proof of that except idle speculation from outside observers, not close friends.

[The first federal funding for AIDS research was in 1983 and increased every year after that.](https://www.kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/u-s-federal-funding-for-hivaids-trends-over-time/) It definitely wasn't enough for the magnitude of the situation, but there was some. Funding did improve as cases in heterosexual people, such as Ryan White, became more widely known; the Ryan White CARE Act was passed in 1990 and is ["the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_White) though the funding is for treatment, not research. I don't think any of the research funding went to abstinence campaigns, it's called research for a reason. [However, abstinence campaigns were federally funded by the Reagan administration (Adolescent Family Life Act) and every following adminisrtation, including Clinton (Title V).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education_in_the_United_States#Abstinence-only_sex_education) Funding seems to be from the tens to a couple hundred millions per year. George W. Bush especially emphasized abstinence in preventing AIDS, [requiring one third of the PEPFAR prevention funding to be spent on abstinence-only programs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief#Funding_data) The money could certainly be better spent on comprehensive sex education, but still, it is a small amount of money compared to the total money spent on AIDS research, treatment and prevention.

Clinton-era legislation around porn was centered around the Internet, not physical mail. [The Communications Decency Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act) was a major piece of legislation that attempted to ban depictions and descriptions of sexual activities, as well as anything "indecent or obscene", from any part of the Internet accessible by minors. The indecency part was very quickly struck down by federal judges; the Supreme Court upheld their decision in [Reno v. ACLU (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_v._American_Civil_Liberties_Union). (The obscenity bit is mostly irrelevant because of the [Miller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_test) - in order to prove that something's obscene, you'd have to somehow prove that it "lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.") A slightly narrower 1998 law followed a similar path, while a 2000 law that only targeted libraries and K-12 schools that receive federal funding was upheld.

Within months of the Bryan Kocis murder, the porn world was rocked with another gut punch. <mark fc=false>The streaming video software they had helped to create in the late 90s</mark> was coming back to haunt them: the launch of Pornhub.com.

It was a copyright nightmare, the legal fees of which could send many companies into bankruptcy.

PornHub tried to gain some goodwill from the industry by taking action and removing copyrighted content, but industry professionals didn't care. PornHub was breaking the business model that had been in place since the days of mail-order loops. If you wanted to watch porn, you paid for it.

Content hosts, including PornHub, are legally obligated by the DMCA to remove copyrighted content when the copyright holder notifies them of the infringement (T[he Explosion of Free Porn Online -- New York Magazine - Nymag](https://nymag.com/news/features/70985/), [PornHub: How 'the YouTube of sex' changed the porn world - and how it may still destroy it | IBTimes UK](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pornhub-how-youtube-sex-changed-porn-world-how-it-may-still-destroy-it-1554844)). Fulfilling baseline legal obligations would not garner any goodwill. More annoying to the industry is the speed and frequency with which copyrighted material can be uploaded because the DMCA does not require hosts to proactively remove infringing material (same sources as above), so the video may be referring to “third-party content fingerprinting” upon uploading (IBTimes article above), which was implemented in response to a lawsuit ([Ventura Content, Manwin Settlement Includes Vobile Provision - XBIZ.com](https://www.xbiz.com/news/125964/ventura-content-manwin-settlement-includes-vobile-provision)).

MindGeek's secret monopoly has changed the world of porn for good. Studios now run on a “quantity over quality” basis, constantly fighting to make sure they have enough content to keep subscribers happy and paying. Unlike the mainstream film industry's disastrous response to Netflix, porn studios have adapted quickly. Helix Studios, for instance, has become well known for producing videos that are closer in quality to high-end independent films than the overly lit multi-camera soap-opera-looking videos from Sean Cody and Men.com. And they're not alone. Cocky Boys is another studio aiming for a more cinematic quality to their porn, hearkening back to the days of when pornographers looked at adult movies as sexy films with a lot of sex instead of just sex.

Gay porn has changed a lot over the last 70 years, from the photos of Bob Mizer to the films of Tom DeSimone and Wakefield Poole, to the creation of studios like Falcon and Catalina, through the AIDS crisis and thousands of lost lives, the creation of the Internet, unprecedented growth, violent murder, the rise of a monopoly, and now the democratization of the industry. <mark fc=false>Gay porn helped to create the home video market,</mark> <mark fc=false>helped push VHS to a win over Betamax,</mark> <mark fc=false>and developed the very technology being used to stream this video today.</mark>

The story of gay porn in the 20th and 21st century is a lot like that of gay people ourselves: hidden in the closet like so many Bob Mizer photos, sparking a revolution to be acknowledged, fighting through a plague no one wanted to see us get through, and finally, now, to some kind of acceptance in the mainstream. Though many would be loath to admit it, gay porn has helped to shape what it means to be gay. It was a rare look at gay sexuality when we were nothing but villains and jokes in Hollywood films. A place to feel accepted when straight couples lined around the block to see *The Boys in the Sand*. A fantasy refuge from the AIDS crisis when being gay could be a viral death sentence. A digital space to feel accepted in when the Bush administration fought to enshrine gay discrimination into the Constitution. A place to see ourselves as desirable when people call us freaks.

It says something about our society that porn was at its most popular, its most mainstream, 50 years ago, <mark fc=false>with *The Boys in the Sand* and *Deep Throat* being bigger hits than anything Hollywood put out.</mark>

Again, *Boys in the Sand* was not "a bigger hit than anything Hollywood put out" - [Wikipedia cites it as making $25,000 in its first week and $140,000 in its first six months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_in_the_Sand#cite_ref-Burger_20-0), so though very profitable, it was not getting the millions of dollars that mainstream films received. *Deep Throat* was much more popular - [it had up to $20 million in domestic rentals, giving it the 7th highest box office for 1972](https://web.archive.org/web/20080615024149/http://www.boxofficereport.com/database/1972.shtml) - but *The Godfather* made over $80 million domestically. However, *Deep Throat* is a heterosexual hardcore film, not a gay hardcore film, which is what James is describing in the rest of this epilogue.

<q>What happened?</q> <q>Why did porn go back in the closet?</q> The conservative tsunami that hit North America in the 1980s certainly did its part, but have we not progressed since then? Gay men and women fought and won the right to get married and serve in the military, two of the most conservative institutions on earth.

And yet, many gay men won't admit that they watch porn. <mark fc=false>In a 2019 poll, <q>66%</q> of gay men <q>said they were embarrassed to talk about porn with friends.</q></mark> They were afraid people would think they were perverts. While 50 years ago, we stood in line to see porn in a movie theater.

I can find no evidence of this survey existing.

I think the majority of people of any sexuality would be embarassed to talk about porn with their friends, yes? Or researchers, for that matter.

Porn isn't about to have a theater resurgence, not when Hollywood itself is going more and more digital. But I believe we need to open our minds and stop being ashamed of who we are and what we watch. We fought for decades to not have to hide in a closet, and yet, we keep our porn hidden. We fought to not be a shame to our families, to not be shamed by the population at large, for loving who we love, and here we are, two decades into the new millennium. We can get married, serve in the military, run giant corporations, run for president, and yet we're still ashamed. Not ashamed of being gay, but ashamed of gay sex. I think it's time we stop being ashamed.

I don't know man, this probably isn't the most pressing issue facing the gay community. No one want to talk about porn, regardless of sexuality, and there's probably better ways to decrease shame around sexuality, like proper sex education. This is kinda pushing the "being gay is all about sex" myth a bit, yeah?

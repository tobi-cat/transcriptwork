I just wanted to drop a content warning here, as both physical and psychological abuse are discussed in this video. 

I also wanted to thank chAosOPUS STUDIO, who composed the score in this video. They're also an animal welfare charity that raises money through the creation of LGBT+ media, including an upcoming animated adaptation of *Killing Stalking*. You can check them out at the link in the description.

So, if you're anything like I was circa six weeks ago, you're probably thinking, “What the hell is *Killing Stalking*?” I, too, was once so naïve. You see, the day I released the "Power Couple" video, I got an emergency call to come home because my mom was in the hospital. Home for me is a five-hour drive away, so instead of premiering the video as planned, I just set it to “live,” jumped in my car, and drove. My mom pulled through, thank God, but it was pretty touch and go for a while, so as I waited in the hospital and in my hotel room, I started checking the comments on the "Power Couple" video: ;ots of love, which I definitely needed right then, but there were also a few people absolutely *haranguing* me because they thought the couple in the video's thumbnail wasn't Wiccan and Hulkling from Marvel Comics, the subject of the video, but Yoon Bom<sup class="add">[sic: Bum]</sup> and Sang-wo<sup class="add">[sic: Sang-wo Sangwoo]</sup>, and they were absolutely furious that I would have the gall to portray them in any kind of positive light. And all I could think was, “Who the hell are Yoon Bom and Sang-wo?” If I wasn't already in such an emotional state, I would have ignored the comments as simply being misinformed, *but* they were calling me out on a bad day, so I decided I'd better do some research. So, I used the hotel's honestly shockingly good Wi-Fi to hop onto the good old Google.com and look up Sang-wo and Yoon Bom. This is when I came across the Korean webcomic *Killing Stalking*. And right below that in the Google search, in the “people also ask” section, was the question, “Does Sang-wo love Yoon Bom?” Oh, they're gay! Let's investigate.

<comment {% include commenter for= anon %}>

Throughout the video, Somerton mispronounces the main characters' names. In what I've done of the script, I've written Sangwoo and Bum's names accordingly (ex. "Bam," "Sanwoo"). The correct pronunciations go thus:

Yoon Bum (Korean: 윤범, (Revised Romanization: Yun Beom)
윤 /jun/
범 /pɘ(ː)m/

Oh Sangwoo (Korean: 오상우, O Sang-u)
오 /o̞(ː)/
상우 /saŋu/

Yang Seungbae (Korean: 양승배, Yang Seungbae)
양 /ja̠ŋ/
승배 /sɯŋbɛ/

Now, because I'm a good, law-abiding citizen who would never, ever, ever pirate something <u>[brief clip of what is meant to be a torrenting interface, but is just actually stock footage.]</u>, I hunted around online for the books of *Killing Stalking*, which I was seeing described as a psychological romance, romantic thriller, and dark romance. But try as I might, no online bookstore would sell me an English version of the comic. French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, and Korean versions were plentiful and even available with Prime shipping, but *nothing* in English. *Fine*, I'll do the bad thing and read it online.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for= anon %}>

Somerton's Google search of Killing Stalking literally shows that he accessed the Lezhin page on March 29th; he chose to completely ignore linking it just so he could mention piracy. I can only assume he saw the date and wanted to cover his tracks by saying he didn't know the website existed, so it wouldn't look like he ignored one of the first results (ignoring Lehzin's trailer on YouTube and Wikipedia stating that it's been officially licensed).

It is technically possible that Somerton, for whatever reason, missed the Lehzin Comics page where the official English translation is hosted, but that is assuming he missed it on Mangadex.org - where a lot of scanlations are posted in their best quality - didn't see the Mangaupdates page - where the aforementioned translations are often linked - or even the MyAnimeList page - where it already was mentioned that the series had been licensed by Lezhin. It is especially weird though that he never even mentions Lezhin since he got the help of (the now mysteriously defunct) chAosOPUS STUDIO to do the animation, who I presume would know where to read the series officially and could tell him so he could link to it.

Well, shit. So, because I had nothing better to do than sit in hospital rooms and hotel rooms, I read the whole thing in two or three days: all 67 issues, multiple special issues, holiday issues, and author notes. And it was good, a dark psychological thriller about loneliness, trauma, and severe abuse, closer to a horror novel than a thriller. Right in my wheelhouse.

But then, I thought back to how I'd seen it described online. Dark, yes; psychological, yes; thriller, yes; but romance? It had *always* been described as a romance. Who the hell was describing this as a romance? According to the internet, um, a lot of people. Which — suddenly, I understood why some commenters were so angry that they thought I'd used an image of *this couple* and put “power couple” beside it. And because I'm never one to turn down making a mistake, I decided to dive deep into the *Killing Stalking* fandom, which has a surprisingly large presence on TikTok.

Personally, I'd loved the series. It was something akin to Gillian Flynn novels: stories about extremely flawed, emotionally broken people. But what I saw online was a community obsessed with the “romance” between the two lead characters, the emotionally stunted Yoon Bom and the serial killer he's infatuated with, Sang-wo. Now, before we talk about *why* looking at their relationship as anything even *close* to a romance is wrong, let's go over the plot of the series so that *you* know what *I'm* talking about.

## Part One: Tainted Love

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yoon Bom is a depressed 20-something who's had a pretty hard life. Having lost his parents at a young age, he's been brought up by his grandmother and abusive uncle. He was drafted into the Korean military -- military service is compulsory in South Korea -- and despite his frail body and psychological instability, he's still forced to serve. While in training camp, he becomes the target of other recruits, who accuse him of being gay and make fun of him for looking like a girl. 

In one such altercation, his attackers are just about to rape him when he's rescued by another recruit, a handsome young man a few years his junior, Sang-wo. Ever since then, Yoon Bom has become infatuated with Sang-wo. After both completed their term of duty, he began following him around, finding out where he lived and even figuring out the security code to his house based on which buttons looked to be pushed the most. 

Yoon Bom essentially becomes the "stalking" in *Killing Stalking*. One day, he manages to actually get into the house, though he's almost thwarted by a police drive-by. Once inside the house, he's almost euphoric to be in Sang-wo's private space. He has a look around but starts to hear noises from the basement. He goes down, partially hoping to find Sang-wo, but is shocked to find a mutilated young woman tied up and screaming for help. But when he takes off her blindfold, she screams for him to stay away. Bom hasn't noticed that Sang-wo has snuck up behind him, having been told that someone was in his house by the police outside. One of those officers, by the way, believes that Sang-wo killed his own parents, but we'll get to that later.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So, Sang-wo smashes Bom over the head with a bat. He tries to escape, but can't get past the much larger Sang-wo. And so, in an act of panic, he professes his love for him, telling him that he's been in love with him for years, ever since the military. Sang-wo seems to calm down with this and even invites him upstairs. When Yoon Bom asks if he's been forgiven for breaking into his house, Song-wo says yes... but not with his legs in that state, eventually destroying Bom's ankles with a sledgehammer. And here, in this dark basement, guest starring a soon-to-be corpse, is where the “love story” of Son-wo and Yoon Bom begins. It's not problematic at all! 

But when Bum wakes up, now chained next to the girl -- who is now dead, by the way -- Song-wo confesses that although he kills women on the regular, he hasn't killed a man since his father. He starts force-feeding Yoon Bum some sort of *porridge gruel* before leaning in and kissing him, and Bum, instead of fearing for his life, which would, you know, be understandable in the situation, wonders to himself, <u>[heart with the words appears]</u> “Does this mean we're *dating*?”

So, after an unspecified amount of time chained up in the basement (assuming weeks), Song-wo decides it's time to bathe Bom, bathbomb, to wash him. Once he's all clean and now dressed in girl's clothing, Sangwoo tells him that he's going to let him live under *two* conditions: he never passes the threshold of the stairs at the house’s entrance, and he has to do all the cooking, cleaning, and other housework. Essentially, Bom, under pain of death, is made into Song-wo's mother. But, Bom needs to eat off of a plate on the floor, presumably because Song-wo doesn't want to humanize him too much. 

And Song-wo watches him like a hawk, even when he's on the floor eating, just *waiting* for him to make a mistake, any mistake, so that he can physically assault him. And he does, on multiple occasions. No offense is too slight to bring on the wrath of Song-wo.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Eventually, Song-wo assigns Bum the task of organizing a collection of shelves in the storage room. While doing so, Bum finds a bottle of rat poison and gets the idea to put it into Sang-wo's food. He'll be fine, because Song-wo never lets him eat at the table, let alone the same *food* as him. But not that night. No... Song-wo invites him up to the big boy table, and Bom is forced to eat first, which makes him violently ill. Later that night, when Bom is done throwing his guts up, Song-wo actually lays him down on his own bed. 

And here, we discover that Song-wo’s father was incredibly abusive, particularly to his mother, and would force the two of them to eat off of the floor, just like he was making Bom do. But just in case you thought the author was humanizing Song-wo in some way, he then follows up his confession by telling Bom that he hates people like him, people who are always complaining about their lot in life, that he has no sympathy for broken people, that they're useless, but for *one thing*. 

And then, we find out what that one thing is with an insanely awkward sex scene that is, despite what many fans think, *rape*. The power dynamic between the two is too vast; Song-wo has far too much control over Bom for it to *not* be rape. Sorry, shippers, this isn't a loving sex scene, it is sexual assault where the aggressor is a serial killer and the victim is psychologically underdeveloped. *This! Is! Not! Romantic!*

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Anyway, Bum continues to do everything he's told, creating a bond of trust with Song-wo, leading to Song-wo one day saying that he needs to go out for a little while. Bom immediately decides *this* is the time for him to make his escape. He changes his clothes. He passes the threshold and approaches the door, but then he stops... and starts thinking. Yes, life with Sonko is pretty terrible, but he hasn't been *so bad* since they had sex. Not nice by any means, but not terrible. But if Bom escapes and goes home, he'll be left at the mercy of his abusive uncle, who, we've now discovered, has been raping Bom since he was a child. But at least then, he'd have a modicum of freedom. And so, he opens the door, smelling fresh air for the first time in months. 

But sitting on the stoop, waiting for him, is Song-wo. This was a test, you see, a test that Bom has failed. And so, Song-wo assaults him, leaving him a bloody mess in the street, all the while laughing and yelling, “Somebody save him!” But nobody comes. This area is mostly deserted. It's a bad area of town. Bom can yell and yell, but no one will save him. Song-wo takes him back into the house, throws him back into the basement, and tortures him in a scene that would feel at home in *Saw*.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now, as I mentioned earlier, one of the police officers we met in the first issue has been looking into Song-wo because he's thoroughly convinced that he killed his parents. The details around their deaths are just too sketchy. This has been running throughout the series, by the way. 

He eventually decides it's time to investigate Song-wo's house and does a walk-through. He looks everywhere but doesn't find any evidence of foul play. He also doesn't find Bom, which Song-wo notices. Once the officer leaves, still very suspicious, Song-wo flies into a fit of rage, convinced that Bom used this opportunity to flee. He searches the house, the basement, outside, and he can't find him anywhere! 

But once back in the house, he finds Bom on the floor; he's been hiding from the cop. He grabs him, near in tears, saying they're going to be together forever. In fact, Sonko decides it's time to win Bom over, so, he gives him some crutches, since Bom's ankles are still wrecked, and takes him shopping for new clothes. At one point, Bom is actually alone in the store. This is a public mall. He's got the chance to escape. He can approach a security guard, he can call 9-1-1, this is his *chance*! But instead, he starts to panic and looks for Sonko instead.

*Stop!* Okay, that's enough synopsis-izing for now. We need to talk about <q>Stockholm syndrome</q>. This term is thrown around a lot, and most cops and even psychologists question its validity, whether or not it even exists. But in my opinion, *Killing Stalking* is a textbook case of Stockholm syndrome in theory, at least. The term originates from a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden in 1973. Jan-Erik Olsson took four employees hostage during the robbery and held them captive for six days in one of the bank's vaults. When finally released, none of the captives would testify against Olsson. Instead, they began raising money for his defense fund.

People like to throw around this “diagnosis" for a lot of things, like Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*, where it 100% is not applicable. But here, it 100% is. Yoon Bom hits every single one of the diagnostic triggers for Stockholm syndrome. He feels Sangwoo is being compassionate toward him when he so much as lets him eat. He not only develops positive feelings for Sangwoo but full-on falls in love with him; at least, he believes he does. He helps Sangwoo to commit murders and even dispose of bodies. He feels pity for Sangwoo after finding out about his abusive childhood. He eventually won't run away, given the chance. Sure, his first attempt failed, but what about in the mall and multiple other instances during the series? He's suspicious of the police officer trying to help him. And finally, he refuses to assist the police when given the opportunity to do so.

Eventually, the story moves on to the point where the police officer has gotten enough evidence, he believes, to arrest and convict Sangwoo for murder and kidnapping. He brings both Sangwoo and Yoon Bum to the police station, but Yoon Bum won't say a bad word about Sangwoo. He's the only witness they've got, and he won't say a thing, especially after Sangwoo declares to the police station that he and Bum are a couple, that he loves him. This declaration sends Bum into a euphoric tailspin, resulting in him agreeing with everything Sangwoo says, refusing to cooperate with the police, and, eventually, the police dropping all possible charges. Even after Sangwoo tells him that he was just lying to get the cops off of his back, Yoon Bum holds on to the original declaration of love. That's what he wants to remember, and so that's what he will remember.

As the series progresses, we get deeper and deeper into the supremely toxic relationship between these two men. It becomes clear, if it wasn't already, that both are mentally ill. Yoon Bum has severe <q>depression, anxiety, and abandonment issues</q>, while Sangwoo is a <q>narcissistic psychopath</q>. He has a very high opinion of himself, and anyone who isn't him is basically scum, tools to be used by him until they're no longer useful to him. And that's what Yoon Bum becomes to him: a tool, especially for sex. These sex scenes are violent, disturbing, and painful to read. It's honestly very hard to believe that certain fans think that they were written to be romantic. Yoon Bum begins to represent Sangwoo's mother in more ways than one as well. Not only does he care for Sangwoo in a motherly way, but in a series of flashbacks, we also learn that Sangwoo's mother sexually molested him as a child, and so his now-regular sex with Yoon Bum is a continuation of the relationship with his mother.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

This drawn connection between Yoon Bum and Sangwoo's mother eventually becomes a source of anxiety for him, though. You see, Sangwoo's mother was actually the one who killed his father. He didn't do it, his mother did, but in a blatant act of gaslighting, she convinced her son that he killed him. In a fit of paranoia, his mother decided that Sangwoo needed to die as well, and so, she tried killing him with the very rat poison that Yoon Bum attempted to kill him with early on in the series. Sangwoo eventually discovered this and killed her, arguably in self-defense. And so, the people he trusted most in his life, his mother and his father, both betrayed him in one way or another. 

And now, near the end of the series, he fears that Yoon Bum will do the same thing. After an injury leaves him unable to leave the house, he's forced to rely on Yoon Bum to do the grocery shopping and run errands, convinced that Yoon Bum is either going to run away or kill him. Bum never does, though, but the paranoia remains. During this time, the police officer who had been trying to bring Sangwoo down has been having, more or less, a mental breakdown, but a confluence of events gets him back into the case, leading into a violent confrontation between himself and Sangwoo. When Sangwoo is restrained, he calls for Yoon Bum to get the knife that he dropped and kill the cop to save him. Bum gets the knife but can't do it. He lets it clatter to the floor. Sangwoo is shocked, looks at Bum, and says, simply, “I don't need you anymore.” The cop orders Bum to run away. Once out in the pouring rain, he stands outside, looking at the house that's been his home and prison for God only knows how long. Inside, the battle continues, and thanks to a gas stove and a lighter, an explosion rips through the building. 

Yoon Bum is taken to the hospital, where he recovers from his multiple wounds. When he gets out, he goes in search of Sangwoo, who, last he'd heard, was alive in another hospital. Here, we learn that Sangwoo is dead, not from his injuries, but by being smothered by another patient. She couldn't handle his mumbling through the bandages day and night, all the time, calling out Bum's name. The series ends with Yoon Bum seeing who he thinks is Sangwoo, even though he's dead, and running into traffic to chase after him.

## Part Two: Crazy in Love

When it comes to doing an analysis of *Killing Stalking*, we're going to run into some problems. What's the subtext that the author is trying to get across? What are we intended to come away with? Does it even matter? Do the author's intentions matter? How much context is needed for *Killing Stalking*, and what is meant to be just taken at face value? I, for one, find it very unsettling that it's perceived as romantic, not only by the shippers, by the way, but also by a great many people who read the comic and do understand that it's toxic. Alright, so if it's not a romance, what is it? It's a horror thriller, obviously. This isn't even a psychological thriller, this is full-on horror. Sangwoo is closer to Jigsaw than Hannibal Lecter. There are a few other themes that the work might be trying to talk about as well <q>treatment or dismissal of the mentally ill</q>, <q>the dangers of a culture which thrives on obsession</q> (this is coming from the land of K-pop, after all), and <q>the negative effects of compulsory military service.</q>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Though I can't speak to the reality in South Korea, in North America, mental illness is absolutely treated as something for which you might see a psychologist a handful of times, where you'll eventually be put on meds and never checked in on again. And that's if your insurance even covers it. I have a pretty good job, and it still only covers two psych visits a year. The mental-wellness institution, as a whole, generally doesn't much care about you. Yoon Bum gets the overarching diagnosis of <q>borderline personality disorder</q> because he obsesses over people, and then he's just tossed out into the street. It really resonates with how I see the system failing people with mental illness in the real world every single day, not to mention that in spite of his history of mental illness, he is drafted for service in the Korean military. Because instead of treating people and offering them the strategies and coping mechanisms they need, we're going to isolate them in an environment that is built to withhold special treatment in order to foster an environment of conformity. At which point *Killing Stalking* asks a very strange question of the reader: to discern where individual decisions begin and where societal familial conditioning ends. At what point is a toxic individual a failure of a society at large, and at what point should we start judging them for their own actions?

## Part Three: Is it Love?

<james {% include timecode %}>

Anytime we analyze a story that is at all left open for interpretation, there are going to be people who disagree with your take on it and just yell, <q>“You just don't get it!”</q> Now, I don't think there actually are multiple ways of looking at *Killing Stalking*; it's a horror story, not a romance. But a lot of people are coming away seeing it as a romance, so is their interpretation wrong? Yes. But let's pretend it's not. Let's pretend that this story's themes are vague and look at it alongside some other works of art that people disagree on. Art is in the eye of the beholder, after all. Is *Killing Stalking* a surface *Beauty and the Beast*-style romance where the monster can change in the end, or is it, as I believe, an analysis of trauma and abuse? Granted, there have been any number of times when an audience, especially an academic one, falls into the trap of just assuming that everything is deeper than it really is. In fact, in some cases, people read into a work of fiction to find layers when there are none intended just to justify their appreciation of it. But even when things aren't done to deliberately troll intellectuals, there's a trend of intellectuals taking a body of work and saying “well, if this play is deep, then they all must be deep.” Like, half of Shakespeare, if not more. Is that a hot take? No - not really. Like, come on. The man wrote almost 40 plays in 20 years; you can't expect every one of them to have a nuanced, insightful world vision. He had to put food on the table for him and his troupe of actors and his boyfriend. He was a businessman before he was a creator. Most of what he wrote was on commission. That doesn't mean that *Hamlet* or *Macbeth* aren't excellent expressions of literary subtlety, but there isn't much that's subtle [clips from the movie version with Anthony Hopkins] about *Titus Andronicus*, where the hero takes the two sons of the villain, bakes them into a pie, and feeds them to her. [Back to James.] It's basically Shakespeare's slasher movie, which — that's why it's my favorite Shakespeare play.

And the biggest fallacy of his career was that *Romeo and Juliet*, arguably his most iconic work, wasn't meant to be a classic. [Clips from the Baz Luhrman movie adaptation, alternating with James.] Like, big shock time: all those guys in high school English who gagged at the gratuitous romance in the play, who were dismissed by the English teacher, were actually right. See, aside from the fact that this is a grotesque amount of romance that chokes out what little plot actually exists in *Romeo and Juliet*, there are a number of dated cultural contexts that highlight that this is a relationship Shakespeare would have considered toxic. Taking this into consideration, it becomes a cautionary tale. Juliet referring to her love as being in excess was a key feature. Elizabethan England was stuck in a bit of an austerity kick where modernity and temperance were strongly valued. Anything in excess was seen as dysfunctional, so the fact that they both die at the end [clip from Luhrman adaptation plays with gunshot audio. Text overlay: “And we all know that people just calmly rest their head on a pillow after blowing their brains out.”] really should have been a tip-off. Shakespeare was probably thinking, [James, with pinhole effect, sepia filter, and British accent] “The fact that their affair leads to both of their deaths should tell audiences that this is bad. Nobody's going to find death romantic.” [Back to James without pinhole or sepia.] *Romeo and Juliet*, therefore, should not be viewed as a romance, but a satire, a parody of romance and romantic plays. [Clips from *Spaceballs* and *Dracula: Dead and Loving It*] I'm sure most people are more accustomed to hearing about satire and parody when it's comedic, which — it is much easier to make a clear, thematic satire when it comes to comedy. But satire is just a matter of pushing a medium into the territory of the carnivalesque. [Back to James.] Actions, decisions, reactions, and elements of design and theme are so absurd that they reach a point where it's impossible to take them seriously.

Romeo and Juliet was a commercial hit almost from the start ([Stage history | Romeo and Juliet | Royal Shakespeare Company (rsc.org.uk)](https://www.rsc.org.uk/romeo-and-juliet/about-the-play/stage-history)). Furthermore, the previous discussion of Shakespeare’s commercial leanings undermines this point: if his plays were business ventures, literary merit would have been unnecessary.

[James] mischaracterizes the plot [of Romeo and Juliet]. The play is about a romantic relationship, so discussions of marriage, love, sex, and courtship occur throughout the text. However, direct conversation between Romeo and Juliet is less than ten percent of the play (255 lines [Parsing Is Such Sweet Sorrow | FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/parsing-is-such-sweet-sorrow/) out of 3096 [Length of Shakespeare Plays | Stage Milk](https://www.stagemilk.com/length-of-shakespeare-plays/)). Direct conflict between other Capulets and Montagues drives much of the plot as well.

Shakespeare likely did not consider the emotions driving the relationship toxic, but he may have intended to criticize the lovers for marrying without the approval of their families (A Modern Perspective: Romeo and Juliet | Folger Shakespeare Library).

The word “excess” appears once in the play (act 2, scene 6). Irrespective of Elizabethan morality, the context of the scene does not lend the word as much importance as the video gives it.

This does not appear to be true [that Elizabethan England valued modernity and temperance]. Elizabethan artwork (Elizabethan England | Essay | The Metropolitan Museum of Art | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History (metmuseum.org)) and clothing (Elizabethan sumptuary laws: Fashion policing in Shakespeare’s England | Blogs & features | Shakespeare's Globe (shakespearesglobe.com), Clothing and fashions in Elizabethan England | Folger Shakespeare Library) tended toward the ornate with regulations based on one’s income and social status, an attitude that implies a tolerance of excess and limited temperance.

I can find no scholarly source that regards the play as purely satire, though there are certainly satirical and parodic elements of the play.

At least, that's the idea. Satire is usually comedy, [clips from *The Producers*] because if you're trying to defame the Nazis, it's easy to do so by making them look like fools, because you're simply taking elements of how they already were foolish in history and amplifying it. [Back to James.] Sometimes, you can get away with being honest in comedic satire because the events that you were making fun of really were that ridiculous, and sometimes, you have to tone it back, or people will think it's too over the top. [Clip from *The Death of Stalin*.] “Stalin is invincible, the force of [ __ ] death. Back to the salt mine! What's happening? This is impossible. And wonderful! And maybe he's appointing his successor!” A drawback to this is that it's not always entirely clear what is being made fun of. This is especially true in absurdist or ironic depictions. [Clips from *South Park*.] Is South Park making fun of Al Gore, claiming that climate change is an imaginary issue, [back to James] or are they doing the opposite and making fun of the people who dismiss Al Gore, saying that what they imagine Al Gore acts like isn't the reality of how he portrays himself? And for reference, South Park's defenders often do use the “you just don't get it” defense when it comes to criticisms directed at them, and they do tend to cross the line every once in a while. But this video is not about *South Park*. Satire can also be dramatic, though. This is less common in modern media, however. [Clips from various movies.] Here, we take culture and history and, rather than amplify the ridiculousness, take elements of violence, bigotry, romance, political ideology, or even culture itself, [back to James] and bring the real life absurdity to the audience's attention. The hope is for these themes to be read as societal problems.

A downside to this is that the line between satire and reverence is very narrow. [Clip from *Full Metal Jacket*] Was Stanley Kubrick presenting a horrifying depiction of psychological conditioning, trauma, and groupthink as it exists in the American military in *Full Metal Jacket*? [Back to James.] I mean, that's probably how he intended it. But if you're an individual who values elements of hyper-masculinity, pro-violence, and American imperialism, then you can just as easily see *Full Metal Jacket* as a shining testament to an era [voice over, with a *Full Metal Jacket* clip] when men were men and weak, undeserving men simply snapped under the pressure in which real men persisted. [Back to James.] As for what Kubrick intended, it's a little bit difficult to gauge. He offered phenomenally little information about what his films were intended to really be about. He liked to see them as a litmus test which had more to say about the observer depending upon how they would interpret the film. [Voice over, with a clip from *Eyes Wide Shut*.] This is epitomized in his final film, *Eyes Wide Shut*, which is about… [back to James] something. Even when some of us think there's no way someone could have positive interpretations of a work, there is someone who's going to read *A Clockwork Orange* and think, [with slight visual filter and deepened audio] “Yeah, that's what masculinity means, and the government is the villain because they— they brainwashed him out of his individuality.” [Back to normal video and audio.] But in instances like Kubrick's nuanced vagueness, can we really use intention as a means to analyze works of fiction?

All this is to say that I'm taking an analysis of *Killing Stalking* very seriously, and even though my focus is, as you might have been able to tell, the audience's attitudes about it, it's important to know that people can see art in very different ways.

## Part Four: You Give Love a Bad Name

[Ominous music. Section title, “Part Four: You Give Love a Bad Name,” with separate pictures of Yoon Bum and Sangwoo. Back to James.]

One of the most significant philosophies of art criticism comes from Jean Boulliard. He argues, in very generalized terms, that we, as a society, have lost, or are losing, our ability to tell the difference between artifice and nature, meaning we can't really see a clear difference between a performance and an earnest state of being, what is real and what is counterfeit. And to what degree can we tell the difference between the two? This is more in the vein of, say, being unsure if the Kardashians are errant airheads or whether this role is emphasized in their programming in order to fulfill a brand, which they use to solidify and expand their platform. [Cut to a caricature of one of the Kardashians. A woman says, “Hey, bestie.” Back to James.] This is especially true in instances of long-spanning performance art, as you could see among [images of each person appear as their name is said] Lady Gaga, Cher, Madonna, or even people like Ann Coulter, Donald Trump. Where the performance ends and the individual begins, and how much they overlap, are both areas of debate. An extrapolation of this in the situation of *Killing Stalking* is whether this is intended to be a work of fiction which plays upon and subverts romantic tropes, or whether it's earnestly romantic. When I read it, I read a very conflicted horror story where neither of the main characters were particularly meant to be admirable and where the element of romance was there to highlight the insidiousness of Sangwoo and the dysfunction of Yoon Bum. As this is a visual novel, meaning that the visual language is just as important as the written text, [over panels from the cartoon] there are a number of instances in the comic itself, specific panels, which can be removed and shown as romantic. [Back to James.] Instances of cuddling, hugging, and kissing are all present. Granted, this is usually before or after someone is tortured, or killed, or buried. Very romantic.

But does this ability to separate these romantic elements form a kind of phantom plot in which the perceived romance runs parallel to the actual depiction of the toxic relationship? This could encourage someone to, against all reason, deliberately read romance into situations where there is none. This is to say nothing of the special issues for [said over a panel from a holiday issue] Christmas and Thanksgiving [back to James], whereas Sangwoo and Yoon Bum are depicted romantically or erotically and without any torture, except for the people that they are murdering and disposing of. But they're doing it together! On one hand, is this a matter of depicting a relationship at peak toxicity, or is this exploiting a will-they-won’t-they romantic format to keep audiences tuned in for 67 issues? Because in spite of these seemingly apparent layers and the seemingly self-aware damnation of its own content, *Killing Stalking* has acquired a certain following. In spite of the obvious, or what seems to me to be obvious, messaging about how damaging and traumatic this relationship is, if you can even call it a relationship, which I don't, there is a swath of fans who lean toward the will-they-won’t-they take, that this whole journey is a progressing romance leading to Sangwoo finally giving in to his feelings, stopping hurting Yoon Bum, and then running off together with him. The torture has been fantasized as a kind of “love you to death” kind of thing. Like, Sangwoo is so in love with Yoon Bum, but the only way he knows how to express affection is through abuse. All Sangwoo needs to do is learn how to properly express his feelings of affection, and then everything will just turn out fine. Being honest, the implication throughout the series is that Sangwoo keeps Yoon Bum alive because he reminds him of a maternal figure, which you'd think would lead an audience to immediately connect him with Norman Bates. [Clip from *Psycho*: “Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.”] But they don't. But maybe these people haven't watched as many movies as I have, or even the TV show *Bates Motel*.

So, which is it, gore porn or star-crossed romance, or a character study of Stockholm syndrome? We could look to the author, who, in front of every issue, plasters a big old disclaimer that very explicitly says that this is a depiction of abuse and dysfunction. Which, you know, that must clear it up, right? Done deal. Maybe, because we're also in an era of Joanne Karen Rowling prefacing everything with [close up, with feminine British accent], “I love the transsexuals, but…” [Normal image and audio.] This tactic is called dog whistling [images of offensive tweets; see comment], which is doing or saying something hateful, but in a vague enough way that you can credibly say, “That's not what I was actually saying!” [Back to James.] People who are racist and homophobic and transphobic will be emboldened by the message, and people who are indifferent or [political cartoon, said with disdain] centrist [Back to James] will take it for granted as a joke, and even they themselves dismiss the haters as social justice snowflakes. In periods past, it was considered a point of pride to clearly advocate for your beliefs, but these were also eras which had a very clear hierarchy of privilege, and there was no shame in supporting the hierarchy. Today, where the majority of progress is dedicated to dismantling these systems of privilege and oppression, there is an awareness of the right thing to say, even if you don't necessarily believe it. Indicative of the [close-up, with a redneck accent] “I'm not racist, but” [back to normal shot and voice] line that always is followed by something racist. People want to be seen as progressive, or at least on the right side, while still holding on to privileged attitudes and cultural stereotypes. Even bigoted people know how to properly carry themselves in order to advance their platform and not do or say anything too extreme in public (there's a reason the KKK wears hoods) [images from the webcomic], much in the same way that Sangwoo knows how to act like a normal person in society so that he can blend in [back to James] despite being a crazed psychopath. I wasn't just comparing JK Rowling to a psychopath. What are you talking about?

[Ominous music. Section title, “Part Five: I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That),” with a picture of Yoon Bum and Sangwoo under a sheet. Back to James, with the background color gradient switched and the lighting on James’ face blue.]

## Part Five: I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That)

So, the series is written by a Korean author and illustrator who goes by the name of Koogi, for whom there is next to no information available online. I did manage to track down and translate an interview from 2018 where she was asked if there was any sincere feeling of love between the two lead characters. She responded [cut to black, with text appearing on screen], “It's up to the readers to decide. If I have to decide, then no.” [Back to James.] Okay. But it's a bit odd that on every site where this is available for purchase, or even for just reading, it's listed as a romance. On Amazon, it's even classified as LGBT+ marriage comedy. She's also said that the book should be categorized as a psychological horror story and not a romance of any kind. Though, to be fair, if you visit her Twitter, the page is mostly populated with romantic fan art of Yoon Bum and Sangwoo, so where she really stands on how the series should be read might be up for interpretation. But let's take her at her word in the 2018 interview that she does not intend on this being read as a romance in any way. Then why does the fan base read it like one, and why, when I did my initial Google search, was it so often described as a psychological romance, romantic thriller, dark romance? Well, there's two answers to that question. [Answers appear individually as text with numbers, then vanish.] One, the fans are doing the categorizing. Two, publishing. Yes, the archaic, slowly dying traditional publishing industry, which has real difficulty when it comes to queer themes in books, especially involving men. You see, when a book is being published, the publisher has to decide what kind of categories the book falls into so that it can be marketed to the proper audience. And when a book comes around with a gay lead character who doesn't have a romance in the plot, they have no idea how to classify it. [Appearing as text] “Women don't want to read a book about a gay. Straight men certainly don't want to read a book about a gay. Gays barely want to read a book about a gay!” But a gay romance? Well, according to market research, women eat that up, so much so that it makes up for the loss of a potential straight male audience. Gay readers don't really factor into the thought process, which is a problem in itself and something I'll cover in another video. [Collage of images from the webcomic.]

And so, we come to *Killing Stalking*. Is this a romance? [Back to James.] No. Even the author says so. But are there romantic elements? Not really. But could there maybe be perceived romantic elements if you tilt it the right way and read it under a quarter moon during February of a leap year? Maybe, so [a purple heart with “M/M” appears, then vanishes] into the M/M romance category you go. They don't just have to pick one category, though, which is why the much more applicable “psychological thriller” and “horror” tags also get put on there. So, when readers are self-categorizing the book online, it becomes a [appears as text, said breathlessly] “psychological romance, romantic thriller, dark romance.” So, from the synopsis of *Killing Stalking*, I think it's pretty clear that both characters, Yoon Bum and Sang Wo, are not mentally stable, but in two very different directions. Both of their lives have become disasters since they were children, with abusive caregivers in both cases. That's why there is no romance in this story: there's no actual love between these two characters. Yoon Bum thinks he loves Sangwoo because Sangwoo rescued him from being assaulted, something that no one else has ever done, not even his grandmother, who seemingly cared for him but looked the other way when her son, Bum's uncle, would beat and rape him. And Sangwoo does not love Yoon Bum; he uses him for sexual pleasure and his own emotional support, but that's it. But you wouldn't think that by going over the comments online. Many, not all, but many, of the fans of this series would have you believe that it's a *Beauty and the Beast*-style love story, a tale as old as time, that it's about two lost souls finding each other and helping each other become whole people. If I've not yet made myself clear, that is not what this is about.

So, why do they think that? Well, Yoon Bum isn't immediately killed by Sangwoo, unlike his other victims; therefore, this must mean that he's special. This must mean that Sangwoo cares for him, whether or not he's good at showing it. Bum should certainly stand out amongst Sangwoo's victims, but that's because he's a man. Sangwoo is a misogynistic sexual sadist, getting joy from torturing and murdering women, and because he is psychologically damaged, he essentially kills his mother over and over and over and over again by murdering women and then goes home to his mother in the form of Yoon Bum, who he then assaults mentally and physically, just like his own father did to his own mother. [Panels from webcomic.] Sometimes, he has moments of clarity where he realizes what he's doing, but they don't last long. Sometimes, he'll even beg Yoon Bum to not leave him, breaking down into tears. [Back to James.] But this is simply emotional manipulation. He's using Bum's abandonment issues to manipulate him into staying. We know this because when Bum drops the knife during the final altercation, Sangwoo tells him he doesn't need him anymore, lashing out at him and calling him down to the lowest. So, what about Yoon Bum? He grew up being neglected by everyone except his sexually abusive uncle, who would tell him that he was gross, disgusting, especially after raping him. He was socially awkward, making it near impossible for him to make friends. When people would start to get close to him, they'd be put off by how shy and awkward he was. [Panels from webcomic.] So, when Sangwoo hugs him, kisses him, says he loves him, says they'll be together forever, [back to James] even after crippling him, choking him, hanging him, and cutting his throat just—just—deep enough so that he won't bleed out, Yoon Bum looks past the trauma and abuse and just sees the affection because it's the only affection he's ever gotten from anyone, so he latches on to it. [Panels from webcomic.] Even after he knows that Sangwoo is dead, he can't let go. [Back to James.] And despite the fact that Sangwoo never shows any unconditional kindness to Bum, even insulting him when doing something that could be characterized as kind, some readers still look for a love story. They've taken an incredibly horrifying, twisted story of trauma and abuse and twisted it further so that they can ship it. They don't see it as a horror story and hope for Bum to escape his monstrous captor, they hope for Sangwoo to declare his undying love. They don't want Sangwoo to get arrested for being a serial killer, they want the pair to ride off into the sunset. This isn't two sad, broken people who have found each other and made each other whole, this is a twisted psychopath manipulating a poor, lonely boy into being his puppet. This is a story that warns us about the effects of long-term abuse on two very different people, how sometimes, lifelong trauma is inescapable without a support system. *Killing Stalking*, in my opinion, is an amazing psychological horror story, one that kept me swiping through those pages, unable to put it down, hoping that Yoon Bum would escape, that Sangwoo would be caught, that Yoon Bum would be rescued and given the help that he needs.

And yet, there are masses of fans out there who want them to get back together in the end, who flame the author online when she ended the series with Sangwoo dead. The monster dies in the end. He doesn't transform into a handsome prince because he always was one. But not all that glitters is gold. The fact that [pictures of Sangwoo shirtless] Sangwoo looks like the man of your dreams is meant to show you that even the person you think is perfect could be a monster underneath, [back to James] to watch out for yourself, to not let yourself get trapped into this kind of traumatic relationship. The author has said, in no uncertain terms, that she did not intend this to be read as romantic, despite her Twitter feed. So, why in seven hells are people, especially teenage girls, reading this as a romance? Well, because they've been raised to.

[Ominous music. Section title, “Part Six: This Is Not a Love Song,” with a picture of Sangwoo about to stab someone and a picture of Yoon Bum with wide eyes. Back to James, with the background color gradient reversed and his face lit in red.]

## Part Six: This Is Not a Love Song

No, *Beauty and the Beast* is not about Stockholm syndrome; it's about a woman who is forced into a castle and has to work at making the monster she shares it with into a respectable human being for her own sake. [Illustration of Beauty opposite the Beast.] The original French folktale functioned as a way to ease young women into accepting marriage arrangements, [back to James] especially those in upper classes, where their husbands were usually the shining exemplars of wealthy male privilege. To the women betrothed, this seemed to be like an awful proposition, and to ease them into it, there needed to be some kind of device that told them that it gets better. You know, so they wouldn't kill themselves. Even if it was an errant lie. That sounds familiar. [Brief image of the It Gets Better project logo, then back to James.] So, it's not like the idea that a woman can change a man is new. Culture has been placing the onus on women to be the active force in taking control of men's behavior for all of Christianized European history, if not longer, and it's from this *Beauty and the Beast* attitude that we get the idea that all a woman needs to change her monstrous romantic partner is a little elbow grease.

And so, we end up here with *Killing Stalking*, which is neither an arranged marriage nor a heterosexual coupling. Very 21st century. At which point, we are at this weird junction where we're kind of pulled between several different thought processes about cultural attitudes towards [camera begins to shake; mild audio distortion] representation, romance, gay men, femininity, femininity in men, art criticism, attitudes around consent, the zeitgeist, fandom, social connectivity and isolation, mental health, social possibility. [Back to normal shot and audio.] Aurgh! Nobody should need to do this. Nobody, nobody, should need to look at *Killing Stalking* and say, “Well, we need to know if the borderline personality diagnosis was an accurate one to say with confidence whether the author meant for this to be read as erotic or not.” No! [With text overlay] Sangwoo kills people. He literally kills people! And not in a dark- avenger, Punisher kind of way. He takes joy in murdering people for fun, full stop. And Yoon Bum, he's not in love with Sangwoo, he just can't tell the difference between love and abuse. If you read this and your first instinct is to put these two fucked-up people together for life, there is a problem. There is a problem with you. There's a problem with our culture. I know from reading the comments of *Killing Stalking* TikTok compilations, which are almost as unsettling as the source material, that a lot of the reader base are young women. Like, middle school. They talk about reading it in class, hiding it from their teachers. Even if you have experimented with dating, you have such a narrow concept of what it means to actually be in a relationship at that age. You have no idea what functional relationship even means. And trust me, a lot of older people don't know, either. This is not just an abusive relationship, this is an abusive relationship engaging in a carnival of over-the-top violence, gaslighting, manipulation, and rape. I am so unsettled thinking about how our society is presenting a young generation with such a twisted idea of romance to the point where there is a shipping community built around these two fuckers. Because this isn't just *Killing Stalking*. This didn't come out of nowhere.

It wasn't straight from *Beauty and the Beast* to this: the pro-romance *Killing Stalking* fandom is just the next logical step in the evolution of romanticizing abuse. [Clips from the *Twilight* series.] Especially when you've got *Twilight*, where Edward and Bella's relationship ticks off every single qualification of an abusive relationship as qualified by social workers. [Back to James.] And still, there is this pining over the protagonists like this is a “they're going to make it after all” love story about making things work, even if [with slight feminine inflection] your parents and society don't like it. [Normal voice. Clips from the *Fifty Shades* series.] Don't even get me started on *Fifty Shades of Grey*. It was hyped up as this racy, sexy, over-the-top, intense sexual romp through BDSM. [Back to James.] And then I read it, not knowing what the hell the hype was about, because I'd read [image of book cover briefly appears] Anne Rice's *Sleeping Beauty* series in junior high. Maybe a little too young, but I was mature for my age. [Clips from films mentioned in subsequent speech alternating with James.] So, in *Fifty Shades*, women kind of swoon over Christian Grey even though he's obsessively controlling Anastasia. He violates safe words, meddles in her personal life, and oversteps boundaries regularly, and the fans are all like, “Oh! Invade my privacy harder, daddy!” Then you get things like *Phantom of the Opera*, which, you know, a lot of people read into the fact that the Phantom, named Eric, is literally a psycho who murders people and tries to lock up his love interest, Christine, in a basement. But in spite of this, you still get fans who [back to James] drone on about how Christine was so dumb not to choose Eric because Eric was just so rawly sexual and overpowering, and oh, he really does care underneath it all! [Sepia filter.] He threatened to kill her. [Grey filter.] Oh, but maybe he's good!

[Back to normal shot.] I read *Killing Stalking* as an honest interpretation of these tropes, which is a hell of a thing to do, subverting toxic literary tropes by confronting them with the reality of how they function in real life. The only difference is that the author doesn't try to force a romance into the text, even if a huge portion of her fans think that she ruined the ending by probably killing off the serial killer. Which is why they fill her Twitter timeline with fan art of their preferred ending of these two characters: Christmases, family reunions, vacations. Sangwoo, a serial killer who killed women to reenact killing his mother [close-up] over and over and over again, [normal shot] finally getting in touch with his feelings, realizing that [panel where Sangwoo says, “I’m not gay”] he was gay all along, [back to James] and taking it upon himself to cater to Yoon Bum's emotional needs. Because no, he's not gay. It is stated in the text, and the author has stated, he is not gay. He is a straight man who is using Yoon Bum as a device or to fulfill his needs. And then, the months that Yoon Bum’s spent locked in Sangwoo’s house and basement with broken ankles? It's just a story to tell their adopted kids. But, you know, [clips from relevant films] Christian Grey learns to share the power dynamic and even sub for Anastasia in the end, and Bella eventually gains the ability to protect herself and thus does not require Edward to be so obsessive. Belle's Beast turns into a man [back to James] who made a whole generation of people realize they preferred furries. [Clips from *Phantom*.] Eric, the Phantom, finally does learn to empathize with someone else's needs and lets Christine go. [Back to James.] Kind of. Not really. There's a sequel called [clip from the movie] *Love Never Dies*. [Back to James.] Don't watch it. At which point, it occurs to me that it wasn't the romance in the story that the fans fetishize, but the possibility of Sangwoo changing and becoming romantic. It's this yearning obsession for a redemption arc that the fans want. It's not even that the fandom is choosing to overlook the abuse and the violence and the murder; the fandom embraces all of this. It's just a part of the bumpy road on the way to love. This is Sangwoo's journey, this is Sangwoo's redemption, this is Sangwoo's story, even though it's not. The story is explicitly framed from Yoon Bum's point of view, and it's his emotions and struggles that drive the plot. Sangwoo, at best, is an obstruction.

But should it be that surprising that audiences are drawn to a character who is depicted [images of Sangwoo] to be attractive? And nearly every review of the book calls to attention just how hot he is. I mean, doesn't everyone want to be with someone who's hot? [Back to James.] What's a little character flaw like [comic panels of Sangwoo displaying the relevant issues] psychopathy and murder [back to James] when you're sexy? All of the fandom is focused less around Yoon Bum's experience and more about how Sangwoo looks, which… A crowd of girls fawning over attractive serial killers, pleading for his innocence, isn't new. I find it weird that this audience is simultaneously dismissive of Yoon Bum as a character while, at the same time, fits into the category of girls who fetishize gay relationships. What's the thought process here? Are a bunch of women looking at a submissive gay man as a cipher, their entryway into this relationship? Or have they just kind of moved past the sadness of *Brokeback Mountain* and the yearning of *Love, Simon*, and they need something a bit more spicy for their gays?

## Part Seven: Love Never Dies

Now, all of this makes me wonder, why did it need to be gay in the first place? Was there anything said in this comic that couldn't have been conveyed if Yoon Bum was a woman, or even if Sangwoo was a woman? Were the sex scenes actually necessary? Did they fulfill a pivotal use in driving the plot? Character, yes. But were so many of them necessary? Maybe if Yoon Bum was a woman, the author would have been more sparing in their use of physical abuse. Maybe it would have hit too close to home. But by making Bum a man, it allows a layer of disconnect. And all the major plot beats worth talking about don't seem to include any elements of sex whatsoever, and it's these sexual moments that the fans latch onto and say, “Yes, the romance is real! Sangwoo just needs a chance to open up!” Which… Even though the author won literary awards in the category of horror thriller, it did go on to be categorized as a romance. Did people pick it up expecting a romance and read into it, or would they have seen that from the very beginning? Textually, it does draw a thin line between teasing Yoon with a romance and teasing the audience, the latter of which is not okay. And I'm not trying to say whether this should or should not have been made because all art has a place. There is a context for every piece of art that can add value to our world, both for enriching our culture, conveying a message about the world we live in, or even acting as a confrontation between what we believe about our culture and what the reality of that culture is.

*Killing Stalking* has a lot of interesting, nuanced, layered, and poignant things to say that make it work as a horror story. And stories like it are actually often enjoyed by people who have suffered abuse, a way for them to see that they're not alone in their trauma. Survivors of abuse can often feel very isolated, so seeing someone who has been hurt like them in fiction can be very cathartic. But all of these things are being overshadowed by how a fetishistically appropriative audience has turned it into a romance novel. And this is concerning to me, not just about how these people read the media they consume, but also if they might think that this type of relationship is normal. Do they have the ability to understand when they are in an abusive relationship? Are they going to do the right things and confront their friends when they're in an abusive relationship? Or are they going to push through and encourage others to do so in the hope that something beautiful will blossom out of the trauma? Or are they completely aware of what is safe and acceptable for them, but their ideas are different for queer people? As we in real life progress more and more towards sexual tolerance and acceptance of safe sexual practices in kink, S&M, and role play, are we challenging fiction to raise the bar? As we have fewer real-life applications of [air quotes] “forbidden love,” are we as a culture raised on folklore about enduring abuse for romance increasing the amount of abuse that must be sustained to achieve true love? We need to be more open to discussing abuse, to listening to those who have been abused so that they might feel comfortable telling their stories, so that people can better judge what is healthy and what is not, what is safe and what is dangerous. We need to make it safe for the victims of abuse to feel safe. Otherwise, people, and not just young people, will continue to think that the relationship between Sangwoo and Yoon Bum is true love, that enduring trauma is fine for the right person, that it's a necessary part of falling in love. Abuse is never a necessary part of falling in love. And so, in the description of this video, I've listed resources and links for anyone who might feel that they've become trapped in an abusive relationship. Abuse is not love. Trauma is not romance. Please, do not let [air quotes] “they can change” trap you in an unhealthy or dangerous situation. Get away while you can, because a happily ever after should never involve pain.

Plaigarism (maybe?)

James Somerton uses an almost direct quote from a purdue.edu page covering Baudrillard at timestamp 29:58 of his “*Killing Stalking*” and The Romancing of Abuse video, without even properly spelling the guys name in the subtitles and saying "in general terms" even when the real sentence was from this page. It was only one sentence before he went off, but this sentence was based off a 2 parter scholar article I can't afford to spend 50$ to read through to check, so take it what you will.

His Words: "One of the most significant philosophies of art criticism comes from Jean Baudrillard, he argues in very generalized terms that we as a society have lost or are losing our ability to tell the difference between artifice and nature."

The .edu page which, according to inspect element, may have been from like 2003 or something?: "His point, rather, is that we have lost all ability to make sense of the distinction between nature and artifice."

Additionally at 36:06 he misattributes a quote from the korean author Koogi to a 2018 interview (presumably) in Korean bc he mentions she's Korean here, but it's actually a 2017 interview with Animeclick.it at Lucca Comics found here in Italian. He also doesn't credit anyone for the translation, though I guess google translate did a fine enough job to get a very similar translation result when manually running the interview in Italian through it.

Hello everyone, and welcome to my tier ranking of the -- it was gonna be 50 but I added two more -- so 52 "best", with *big* ass quotes, LGBTQ movies ever made. I created this list by going through about 16 or 17 best queer movies ever made lists, finding the movies I've actually seen, and putting them all together and coming up with a tier list: "slay," which is, they are, like, amazing movies, must watch; "Fierce," fantastic movies; "fine," which is kind of... they're good, I like them, they're not for everybody; "Flop," I don't like them; "honestly, homophobic," these aren't necessarily actually homophobic movies, they are more so... I really don't like the movies. [laughs]

People have asked me for this kind of thing a lot, kind of recommendations for queer movies, so I figured this would be a fun way to do it instead of me just, you know putting out a list on Twitter,actually make a movie-- "make a movie about it", I'm going to make movies but not right now - actually make a video about it so I can monetize it because YouTube likes to demonetize everything I make. So if it's just me sitting in a chair, I don't- I don't *think* they can demonetize this. They'll probably find a way to demonetize this, but I won't let them because I won't say any dirty words, because I'm [strained]... good and... innocent like that.

But before we actually get to the list, if you just want to skip ahead to the list skip ahead to Chapter Two, but anyway - I just drank a lot of coffee - little channel life update. There's a couple of new videos coming out for September, so be excited for that, or dread them because one of them is talking about *Attack on Titan*, so depending upon your opinion on that. Also in September I am moving to Toronto, so there's going to be a little bit of a gap between when we can make the next video, so we're going to try and get some kind of in the can and ready to go out before the move; Nick and I are both moving to Toronto, very excited about that. We're moving because as you know from the past, we raised a bunch of money for Telos Pictures to make some queer inclusive movies - not queer inclusive, *queer* movies - and where we live now there are no actors, and so we're moving to where there *are* actors and we've already got people applying, so that's awesome.

And if you like the stuff that I do, I would *really* appreciate it if you could sign up for my Patreon. [On screen: Link In The Description :-)] YouTube *consistently* demonetizes my videos - they've stopped rating them 18+ which is nice - but they consistently demonetize the videos, so the only reason that Nick and I are still able to do this is because of Patreon, and we've got some really cool, like, bonus features, Patreon exclusive podcast and all sorts of cool stuff like that, behind the scenes, exclusive videos, there's lots over there. So we would *really* appreciate it if you have the ability to sign up for Patreon, that would be amazing. If you don't want to give your information out to Patreon, you can also sign up as a YouTube member and get the same benefits as the patrons. If you can't sign up for Patreon or the YouTube membership that's totally fine, I know not everyone is in the position to be able to do that, so you know, just liking and sharing and subscribing to the channel is a huge, *huge* help.

That's the housekeeping done, now let's move on to the tier list. 

[The tier list, as described, and currently empty, is presented on the left side of the screen, with James' face on the right.]

The first movie we're going to talk about is *Beautiful Thing* which is a British movie that came out in the early 2000s I believe uh about two boys kind of growing up in not the best area of England and kind of finding each other and you know falling in love and it's cute and stuff it's it's not my favorite movie because it's very low key but it's something that it's a gay movie that isn't stressful it's not incredibly stressful to watch which is a nice change of pace so I'm going to rate it as fine some people are going to hate me for only putting it in fine but like I said that's for the movies that are good but maybe not for everyone maybe everyone doesn't want the sort of low-key thing so that's where that goes 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

more controversy because *The Birdcage* is going in Slay and let me explain my reasoning for that I know a lot of people think *The Birdcage* is very homophobic I disagree *The Birdcage* is if you haven't seen it *The Birdcage* is about two older gay men who have a son together and their son is marrying this lovely girl whose father happens to be an extremely conservative anti-gay politician drama ensues drag ensues it's funny it's hilarious Nathan Lane is perfection Robin Williams just kind of cements his ally status he was the whole reason the movie got made it's based on the French movie and play la caja fall which is also very good but I do prefer *The Birdcage* partially because I absolutely adore Robin Williams may he rest in peace

<james {% include timecode %}>

next up is bohemian rhapsody I'm torn uh I wanna say it's Honestly, Homophobic but remy malek's performance is so good I'm gonna put it in Flop remy malik's performance is really good and of course you know you can watch it just for the Queen music but the kind of backstory of the movie being made is very much the band Queen trying to remove as much gayness from the movie as possible if you know anything about the queer icon that is Freddie Mercury you know that removing his queerness is kind of hard but they did their best yeah it just I I'm not a huge fan of it the director the original director was brian singer but he you know disappeared and whatnot the director who replaced him would go on to make a much better queer biopic the following year which we'll talk about later on on the list it's a Flop remy malik is good though the rest of the movie not so much

next is *Bound* which is kind of iconic so it's going into Slay it's one of the very early movies from the wachowskis it's lesbian kinky wonderfulness it's got gina gershon from showgirls it's got jennifer tilly from the chucky universe and it's it's really good again probably not for everyone just like *The Birdcage* but as far as I'm concerned slay is kind of for the movies that are iconic these are the iconic queer movies that everybody should watch and *Bound* is absolutely iconic and not enough people know about it everyone just thinks of *The Matrix* when they think of the wachowskis and I'm like no the wachowskis were doing stuff long before *The Matrix* that you should be paying attention to for anyone who enjoyed *Sense8* I think you will get something out of *Bound* so definitely worth checking out 

</james>
<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next up we have *Boy Erased* which is unfortunately going into Honestly, Homophobic because the movie has good intentions it wants to bring light to the act of conversion therapy but in doing so it cast a straight actor as the kid being sent to conversion therapy troye sivan is there to try and save it for its gay cred and he does a fantastic job by the way I don't know why he doesn't get more job acting because more jobs acting cause he's a fantastic actor but it's just very much this movie is being made to educate straight people by straight people I don't buy that I don't want that I don't want movies made for straight people about gay stuff straight people have enough movies can we have our gay movies at least boy erased goes into Honestly, Homophobic not because it's homophobic just because I'm kind of like does it need to exist I don't think it does

<james {% include timecode %}>

next up we have boys don't cry which again I'm gonna put this into fine because it is a fantastic movie amazing performances hilary swank won an Oscar for it for good reason she did a phenomenal job as brandon tina but god dang it this movie is sad and depressing and based on a true story so it's not like you know it was like bury your queers or anything like that it's a phenomenal movie that's totally worth watching if you're in the right headspace but if you're not in that headspace don't watch it if this movie were made today and it was an actress playing a transmasc character I would bury this movie I would throw it under a bus 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

okay so next up we've got back-to-back boys in the band the first version of the movie came out in the late 60s I think it was 69 it might have been 70. 1970. recent one came out uh on netflix a couple of years ago directed by ryan murphy the original boys in the band I'm putting up into Fierce because when you look at the time it was released like I said the very very very early 70s late 60s it was kind of revolutionary to have a movie with the entire cast of characters is queer and it was kind of revolutionary because it looked at them as people with you know problems and challenges and they weren't perfect and again not the happiest movie in the world directed by william friedkin who would go on to who had I believe already if he hadn't already he was about to direct the french connection he was going to go on to direct the exorcist so william friedkin and I believe he may pop up somewhere else on this list I can't remember and so the movie is incredibly well made based on the play so like I said kind of revolutionary 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

the netflix movie made a couple of years later also really good actually has I believe it all gay cast or all queer cast at least but that one's going to go in fine because it is a really good movie and it's totally worth watching and it may be easier to watch that than the 60s one just because a lot of people they can't handle old movies for whatever reason it is dealing with a lot of gay self-loathing which I feel like we're past that now I would hope that we're past that now but it's a really good movie and it does have an all-gay cast whereas the original movie didn't so it's kind of a toss-up between the two of them of which one kind of gets more gay points I'm putting the original in Fierce because of how revolutionary it was at the time and the remake in fine because it is still a good movie and it is worth watching and it does have an all gay cast and a gay director and a gay writer but the self-loathing can we get over it please 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next up we have brokeback mountain which I'm putting in Honestly, Homophobic hate me if you want but this movie was is the epitome the epitome of gay movie made for straight people straight actors straight directors straight writers straight people all around it's so made by straight people that they didn't even clue in that having anal sex after eating beans is not a great idea and also based on a novella written by a straight woman who has been kind of problematic in the last couple of years jake gyllenhaal and heath ledger do a great job I don't know I just I I've never got the appeal of the movie like even when it came out everybody was talking about it and I mean it was months before I came to a theater near me because I was in such a small town and when it finally did come and I went and saw it I was expecting to cry because everyone said this movie so sad I got to the end and he's there you know crying into the shirt and everything and I'm like I don't get it still I don't I've watched it since and I don't get the emotional gut punch that people talk about and you know a lot of gay people and this is something I completely understand did kind of put it up on a pedestal and still hold it up on a pedestal to this day because it was so rare to have a gay love story happen in a hollywood movie even though it was independently produced a hollywood studio had nothing to do with it it was independent producers come out of the hollywood machine so I understand why it is put up on such a pedestal and it confuses me like the movie made almost 200 million dollars worldwide on a budget of like five cents you would think there would have been a whole lot more gay love stories at least coming out in the coming years because it was such a moneymaker and it never did I wonder why and this movie also it didn't start the trend but it kind of cemented the trend of let's show gay suffering and trauma so that you know the straight people can be like oh those poor gays and we're gonna see a lot more of that on this list we're gonna we're gonna do gay suffering so an actor can get nominated or win an Oscar okay and we keep doing that 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

next is not a movie about gay suffering cabaret which goes into slay because it is maybe the best musical ever made it takes place in weimar Germany before the rise of the third reich by the end of the movie they have kind of risen but it's before the bad stuff it starts before the bad stuff really starts to happen and you get to follow a bisexual love triangle that is actually bisexual the men are sleeping with the men and the women are sleeping with the men and it's very refreshing and very interesting and I love that in the early 70s we got a movie that won like a bajillion Oscars except best picture that had at its core a bisexual love triangle in a musical and the music is fantastic it's kind of gone down in history as the musical for people who hate musicals I don't hate musicals I love musicals but cabaret is like the best musical I adore cabaret and bear in mind the only reason it didn't get best picture pictures because it came out the same year as the godfather 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

so next we have call me by your name another Honestly, Homophobic movie though I love the chalamet sometimes not so much in dune this is another movie that was obviously made for straight people at least it feels like it was boring it was very boring I know a lot of gay people love this movie specifically gay men really love this movie and are very willing to overlook the let's say questionable age difference I found it so boring brokeback mountain was boring too a lot of gay movies that like everyone loves I find so boring the stereotype of gay people is that we're so exciting and flamboyant and you know we've got the feather boas and the drag and everything and then the movies that everyone is like oh my god I love that gay movie it's so fantastic it's the sad gays who just cry at the end of the movie if they're not crying into a fireplace they're crying into a shirt so Honestly, Homophobic and the book is also horrible don't read it 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next though we have a really good gay movie but I'm a cheerleader which is going into Fierce because it is a really fun movie definitely not for everyone anyone who's kind of gone through any kind of type of conversion therapy probably not the best movie for them to check out because it does it seems like it's making fun of conversion therapy that it's like a very heightened version of conversion therapy but from the people I've talked to who have been through it are like the more you know about conversion therapy the more this becomes a horror movie because it's a lot more real than you would expect and you know it has a happy ending which is rare for gay movies to just kind of have a happy ending that's especially in the 90s it was kind of rare I wish we could go back to the happy endings in gay movies 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

the next movie absolutely does not have a happy ending that is the children's hour which is Fierce because it is a phenomenal movie but oh damn is it sad I talked about it in my history of gay movies video so for more detail you can go there basically women as a teacher gets accused of being a lesbian basically loses her life and then kills herself so not for everyone not for everyone but it is just so good gotta be in the right mindset which means I should put it in fine but I'm putting it in Fierce because it's just so good and the time of which it came out at the time in this in the 60s actually worked to humanize queer people a little bit next we have cruising starring al pacino which I talked about in I think monsters in the closet it's a pretty good movie but it is actually kind of homophobic so I feel like I gotta put it down there because it is actually Honestly, Homophobic I don't think they meant it to be I think they had good intentions but it's still [Music] not the best 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next we have a twofer first up is dallas buyers club which is all about a straight guy with hiv fighting for the ability to get treatment instead of being a movie about say act up or gay men's health crisis or something like that uh it's about a straight texan and this is one where jared leto plays a trans sex worker and of course won an Oscar for it because queer suffering and of course the movie about fighting to get treatment for people with hiv stars the straightest actor in hollywood I'm putting this in Honestly, Homophobic because it honestly kind of is I don't know if there were any gay people who worked on that movie did you have to cast a cis straight man as a transgender woman did the main character have to be a cis straight man dealing with hiv did it have to be again this is another one of those movies that's obviously made for straight people 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

which is again like I said a twofer followed up by the danish girl starring eddie redmayne uh again Honestly, Homophobic in this case transphobic because again a man playing a trans woman isn't great because here's a clue here here's some information for people who don't quite get why that's a problem when it comes to trans characters you are telling the audience that this man is pretending he is acting as literally acting as a woman in the story and then people get it in their heads that trans people are just men acting as women or women acting as men that is problematic and that is bad and that is something that we need to stop doing and I think eddie redmayne has actually come out since this movie and said you know if this was being made today I wouldn't take the role maybe you say you wouldn't take the role because you didn't win an Oscar for this one but you know he's still working with joanne so yeah it goes into Honestly, Homophobic 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next is the life and death of marsha p johnson which goes into slay it's a fantastic documentary about marsha p johnson there should be like an actual hollywood movie about her at this point but there still isn't it is absolutely worth watching because the history is so important to know because there are so many figures in what we call the gay rights movement who were actually trans women and we give them no credit and it is just huge like trans erasure by not giving these women credit for the things that they did and also again kind of doing the danish girl thing by saying like oh you know men fought for the gay rights and then you see marsha b johnson and you think oh maybe that's a drag queen no marsha p johnson was a woman that's why I think everyone needs to watch this documentary 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

which is followed up oddly by disclosure another Slay which is a documentary that's on netflix which is about trans representation in media over about the last century which is first of all an incredibly well made documentary but also points out all the problems with with having cis actors playing trans characters and how that can really kind of give the audience the impression that being trans is just acting it gives so much information and such a quick just in such a quick time absolutely worth the watch check it out it's on netflix everybody has netflix go watch it 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next we have a movie that is little known among the youthful gays edge of 17 which is a movie that came out in the 90s but it takes place in the 80s about two boys who fall in love in the 80s lots of awesome the soundtrack is phenomenal I saw this movie on cable when I was really young it was on at like two in the morning I think I was like 10. I just immediately fell in love with it I can't it's been a while since I watched it but it was really good and I had such a crush on the blonde guy he's got bleach blonde hair I had such a crush on him totally worth the watch but I'm gonna put it in fine because it is very much of the time and so maybe not for everybody but absolutely worth watching especially if you're around my age and it's a movie that you probably should have seen at that time frame you know it's kind of the gay never been kissed kind of thing every 12 year old girl saw never been kissed but every 12 year old boy did not see edge of 17. so definitely worth watching it now to pick up on it 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next we have everything everywhere all at once which I'm not going to talk too much about it goes into slay but I'm not going to talk too much better because there is a video coming out dealing with everything everywhere all at once I'm just going to say watch it all right 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

so next we have a movie that I'm willing to bet a lot of you actually haven't heard of it's called heavenly creatures and it was directed by peter jackson before lord of the rings it was actually the movie that convinced new line cinema to allow him to make lord of the rings it got pj an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay I think it might have been adapted screenplay but best best screenplay it's just this very sad but beautiful story of two teenage girls kind of falling in love and it's this in new zealand in the 1950s I think it might be the early 60s but it's that time period the sort of surrealist world they have to create where they can go and be themselves because in the real world everyone is pushing against them it's an incredibly beautiful movie it's kate winslet before titanic it's peter jackson before lord of the rings it's absolutely worth watching it is it's a beautiful movie so heavenly creatures goes into Fierce 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

next is hedvig and the angry inch which I'm putting into slay immediately because it is phenomenal I know a lot of people find it a bit problematic because the main character hedvig is a born a boy and growing up in east berlin and meets an american military general I think and falls in love but in order to get married and get out of east berlin has to have gender reassignment surgery which doesn't go over well the angry inch and so it's kind of this weird middle ground of choosing to be trans but not really wanting to be but then accepting the role of the woman and so it's a lot of people find it problematic but the way I kind of look at it now as the creator of hedvig john cameron mitchell has come out as non-binary I kind of see it as more of them exploring that sort of non-binary identity that in between between man and woman it's just fantastic and the music is amazing and john cameron mitchell was fantastic in it they got nominated for a golden globe but not an Oscar which I feel is just a slap in the face that should have been nominated for an Oscar 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

for the next movie we have another documentary and I'm putting it in Fierce it's called how to survive a plague which is the story of act up which is basically the reason that treatments for aids and hiv actually became available to people they were a nice way of saying it is that they were a protest movement um straight people at the time would maybe even go so far as to call them terrorists but they were not they were a protest movement fighting to make aids treatment available and they're the only reason that hiv and aids today is considered a very livable disease it's something that if you're diagnosed with it's not a death sentence anymore you take a pill every day and you're probably good and it's because of these people that we got there and the fact that thousands of them had to die literally fighting for their lives before we could get there because the government especially in the united states was so just the government just didn't give a damn and I feel like their story really ought to be told because there are a lot of people who don't know the story of act up and don't know the story of the gay men's health crisis and don't know the story of hiv and aids and they just know that it used to kill you and now it doesn't and it's like yeah but the story of how we got there is so important and necessary I feel like a lot of people my age and younger don't appreciate it so much because we came of aids after protease inhibitors kind of kicked in really necessary viewing for people who don't know the full context of what was going on in the 80s and early 90s 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next we have the imitation game which I'm putting into Honestly, Homophobic because we have a person a real life person in Alan Turing who was gay and the movie basically ignores it until the last five minutes and they're like oh and he was chemically castrated by the government has had they focused on his achievements which were amazing achievements in scientific fields and basically won world war ii for the Allies but the movie doesn't really deal with the fact that he won World War II for the Allies for England and then England punished him by chemically castrating him and putting him in a state where he killed himself it very much glosses over it in the end I would have put it into Flop because of that but the writer of the screenplay very vehemently said I this is not a gay movie girl you wrote a movie about a gay man and you are saying it's not a gay movie I am sorry you have mistaken your screenplay for something that it is not and so because of that it goes into Honestly, Homophobic 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

next we have in and out which is a comedy from the mid 90s which is about a man who thinks he's straight for most of his life and then realizes he's gay just as he's about to get married and it's kind of about his coming out process and he's uh late 30s early 40s ish so you know he's oh god older oh I feel old now and it did really well in the 90s and was really well liked in the 90s it is very of its time though it is very much a 90s movie so I'm gonna put it in fine because it's not the best movie ever made by any means it's not the best gay movie ever made it's not great but it's worth a watch like if you're bored and you've watched all the other movies on the list that I'm recommending it's worth putting it on to just kind of see where the mindset of hollywood was when it came to gay people in the mid 90s next we have the movie kill your darlings which I used a bunch of footage from in the recent uh queer panic video in that section of the queer panic video it is the story of that that's what the movie's about it's not a great movie it puts a lot more humanity I think into the character slash real person of lucian carr than he had in real life who may or may not be the progenitor of the demon twink but it is a well-made movie and the performances are really good and there's you know a gay sex scene between deng de haan and daniel radcliffe so I can't say it's a Flop so I'm going to put it in fine but maybe seek out a documentary about the murder if you actually want to know what happened and the whole conflict and everything because it's a bit more complicated than the movie portrays 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

which is a running theme apparently because the next movie is king cobra which is a highly fictionalized version of the murder of brian coaches I talk about this in my documentary making it big it's the story of kind of the drama between brian coaches and brent corrigan sean lockhart the movie has some really solid performances in there especially from garrett clayton and christian slater they do a fantastic job in it gary clayton is a lot more built than brent was at the time considering brent was legitimately underage during his time working with brian it's probably better to have him look a little older but the problem with the movie is that it does not tell the truth it erases real people it kind of moves blame onto different people that weren't to blame it doesn't make brian look completely innocent but it kind of goes out of its way to say isn't it sad that he's dead and it's like well it's sad when anyone is murdered but brian coaches was kind of an absolutely trash person the movie really goes out of its way to make it seem like he wasn't I think they were trying to do that in the screenplay phase to get the family to allow them to use his name which they did not anyway that goes into Flop because I know the story of brent corrigan slash sean lockhart very well intimately and I know that there is a much better movie to be made of it than was made in king cobra

so next we have the looking movie which was produced by hbo as a sort of consolation for not giving it a final season it's fine I think the movie is actually better than the show I watched most of the show and I just could not get into it I tried it like I was expecting it to try and be a new queers folk and it was so boring the fact that I got through as much of the show as I did is entirely because of jonathan groff but the movie is better than the show and so I'm putting it in fine it's worth watching if you did watch the show if you haven't watched the show don't bother because it means you have to watch the show to know what's going on in the movie and then I just I don't recommend watching the show

next up we have the very controversial *Love, Simon* based on the book by Becky Albertalli simon in the homo sapien agenda which I really liked the book and at the time I really liked the movie I do think the movie's really cute but it is very much a movie I I think the filmmaker the film the director um I'm pretty sure he was like meant to make a movie for gay teenagers but what it turned into was a movie for teenage girls and their moms to kind of go ah aren't the gays cute and that's what it became on social media so it's it's not a bad movie I'm also annoyed that the the lead actor is ostensibly straight I don't think he's come out one way or the other I think he's kind of remained vague about it you're making a movie with a gay lead character find a gay actor please they made such a big deal of this movie being so gay and it's like you couldn't find a gay actor in all of hollywood really but I'm gonna put it in fine because it's not a bad movie but if you're kind of older and cynical as I have become since the movie came out you're probably not going to enjoy it

okie dokie so next we have mambo italiano which was a canadian movie made in the early 2000s and kind of aped the um my big fat greek wedding thing except it was italian even though they actually shared a lot of the same actors for the supporting cast because they were like well greeks and italians they look alike it's mediterranean what's the difference and it's a cute movie like it I wouldn't say it's like peak cinema or anything but it's worth watching it's not offensive is it as good as my big fat greek wedding no but neither was the sequel to my big factory wedding I'm gonna put it in fine fine is the middle of the road that seems to be where most of the movies are ending up so that makes sense so yeah worth watching if you're looking for something very light-hearted that you can just put on and kind of enjoy and not have to think about too much and if you want to be exposed to canadian cinema before I do that to you before I expose you to canadian cinema sounds so ominous

anyway next we have a movie from the czech republic called mandragora which I accidentally watched when I was a teenager it's it's a long movie it's like three hours long maybe even longer about a teenage sex worker in prague I believe it's like it's dark as far as like tone it's not dissimilar from requiem for a dream so if you've seen requiem for a dream and you're like I can deal with that for three and a half hours and reading subtitles absolutely worth watching because it's actually a phenomenal movie and nobody like hears about this movie I added this to the list because it's really good it's not on any of the lists because they all ignore movies that aren't in english but I added this to the list because it is really good so I'm putting it in Fierce because it is a really really good movie

next we have maurice which is the movie that made every gay man in the world fall in love with hugh grant and it's really good it's a very it's a very certain type of movie it is um if you've seen any other merchant if you know what a merchant ivory film is you know what the kind of movie I'm talking about it's very slow it's not the most exciting movie in the world but it is really well made and hugh grant does a fantastic job in it as a period piece watching a gay story take place pre-1960s it's almost a novelty while watching the movie and so I'm gonna put it in Fierce the next movie is mayor pete a documentary about pete butterjudge

the next movie is *Milk* the 2008 film starring sean penn as Harvey Milk directed by gus van sant I loved this movie I haven't watched it since 2010 I think somewhere around there it came out while I was in film school and I saw it five times in theaters and I cried every time the ending of the movie with the candles going down the street I just bawled every time total crying mess I took I went so many times because I just kept taking different people I was in school with to the movie and so I'm putting this in Slay because it is an amazing movie it should have won best picture that year in my humble opinion it's a movie that really makes you wonder okay if Harvey Milk had not been murdered how much further along would gay rights have been not just today but like say in the 80s in the 90s at least in like even even just limiting it to california how much further would gay rights have been in california would it have been 2004 before the mayor of san francisco said I'm going to start performing same-sex marriages would that have maybe happened in the 80s or the 90s had Harvey Milk been around to kind of be the mouthpiece for the movement that we really needed and never got again really there was never a sort of martin luther king figure for the lgbt rights movement and Harvey Milk was kind of being set up to be that figure but died before he could really get a national stage he may have been the first gay person to be elected to congress at least the first out gay person and of course you have to take into context that would he have lived through the aids crisis and all of that but even then you know it's just it's interesting to think about how much further along we might have been had dan white not apparently eaten too many twinkies and went and killed Harvey Milk and mayor moscone that day in san francisco

and next we have monster which is going directly into the Fierce category it's not going into slay because it is dark but it is Charlize Theron at her best everyone says she won the Oscar because she got ugly for the role I I do not believe that for one minute she deserved that Oscar because of the performance she gave it was phenomenal it was her being amazing it was patty jenkins being amazing before she had too much control and ruined the second wonder woman movie it was really really good and we don't have enough movies about lesbian serial killers so if you are in a dark mood put on monster it's it's a really phenomenal movie it's kind of been forgotten over the last 20 years it's like oh that movie that Charlize Theron won her Oscar for yeah but it's actually a really good movie and I'd also like to point out which nick just reminded me of Charlize Theron has a trans child who is she is very protective of and she's a huge ally so support Charlize Theron always

next we have moonlight the movie that lost best picture to lala land I mean no it won best picture right faye dunaway doesn't think so she she's still angry about the gays and mommy dearest it go it goes into slay it's a lot of people were like oh it's going to be the black brokeback mountain it's like that's not how movies work you know it follows this person this gay person through their life it's not about their relationship with someone it is about them being a person and they're gay but they are first and foremost a person who is growing up in this kind of environment that you know the overall environment is toxic toward gay people hyper masculine thug crime environment but in the end of the movie he finds someone who allows him to kind of exit that a little bit and we don't know if you know he leaves the life of crime or anything like that but for a moment he is allowed to leave that and be just a person instead of a gangster you know he lets he's allowed to let the facade drop and watching the progression of this character go from this innocent child to this teenager trying to make it through with an incredibly abusive mother to this man who has put up every possible wall to protect himself from the world and the people in it to get to the end of the movie and see him let some of those walls drop for one person it's incredibly touching and I am so sad that it's really for so many people just remembered as the movie that won best picture instead of la la land instead of it being you know one of the best movies made in the last 20 years

so next we have mulholland drive david lynch's lesbian fever dream if you've never seen a david lynch movie this is probably a safe place to start no no I I don't know what I would recommend being the first david lynch movie to watch but mulholland drive is I think along with blue velvet tied for his best movie naomi watch deserved best actress for this movie if you have seen it you know what I'm talking about because she runs the gamut from like innocent girl moving from the midwest to california to be an actress to rung out actress who has been put through it by the system and the hollywood system and is just you know left a junkie in the end oh my god it's such a good movie I I'm still angry that david lynch didn't win best director for this movie because there is there are moments of this movie that reach a level in filmmaking that other movies could only hope to reach there is a moment that is considered the most terrifying moment in film history and this isn't a horror movie this and it's not a gory thing it's just the existence of a type of person and it's considered more horrifying than like anything else ever made and that has nothing to do with the whole the main storyline which is about amnesia and all sorts of stuff it's watch it but watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do and all of your like phone and your phone and computer and everything is off because you need to pay attention to this movie and then watch it again and suddenly everything will click it's one of those movies you gotta watch twice so yeah mulholland drive goes up to Slay because it's one of my favorite movies Flop is missing so many movies I know I'm seeing so much nicer this time I filmed this video once before and I was much meaner the last time

alright so the next movie is my own private idaho uh it's going up into Fierce oh maybe fine see it's better than the movies in fine but it's a movie that's kind of like you need to be in the right mood to watch my own private idaho yeah but man dragora also is that kind of mood and the children's hour so I'm not really following that rule yeah I'm not following the fine rule at all I'm following my heart's rule the movie stars keanu reeves in probably his best performance of his entire career and river phoenix also giving his best performance of his entire career and watching it now it's so like the movie is sad in itself but seeing what river phoenix was capable of and then knowing that he died not long after the movie was made is like wow we've lost a huge talent so it's it's it's like it's a sad movie anyway but it's even sadder with the real life context

so next we have the normal heart which is a relatively recent movie from I think it was hbo based on the play of the same name by larry kramer which is a fictionalized account of the creation of act up in the gay men's health crisis so it's kind of following the same story-ish of how to survive a plague but with kind of different people it's fictionalized because larry kramer had a habit of writing things about his friends and his friends being very angry at him about it so he fictionalized it and they still knew who they were anyway the the cast is kind of split between straight actors and gay actors it's directed by ryan murphy and ryan murphy I think is a much better film director than sort of show runner for tv his tv shows are like great for half a season and then fall off but his movies don't have time to fall off so they just kind of sustain their goodness so the normal heart is going into Fierce not just because it's a good movie but because people need to know more about that time period and they need to know about the people who were actually fighting instead of saying that nancy reagan was a champion of human rights if you know who I'm talking about you know who I'm talking about

so next we have paris is burning a documentary about the ballroom scene in new york city in the 1980s which a couple of years ago I would have put into slay but have recently found out that there's some behind-the-scenes stuff that sucks being that the filmmakers have been very cagey with the people they made the documentary about like were kind of perfectly fine with them living in poverty and didn't try and do anything to help them or anything like that and they were just like let's make a movie about these people so although it is iconic for any drag queen and for any queer person who has watched it anyone who's been involved in the ballroom scene at all if you have watched a single season of drag race you have heard a thousand quotes from this movie but I gotta put it in Flop just because of how the producers ended up treating the people they were making this documentary about

so next we have philadelphia which stars tom hanks and antonio banderas and denzel washington it was directed by jonathan demi right after silence of the lambs and it was his way of apologizing to the gay community for silence of the lambs because lots of gay people were angry at him and lots of trans people were angry at him for silence of the lambs and so he felt like he needed to apologize by making a movie humanizing people in the gay community especially aids victims which was very good at the time because it did kind of you know with tom hanks who had the one-two punch of getting best actor for philadelphia and forrest gump one after the other and it's a very well made movie but my problem with it is that it is very much oh look how the gays do suffer and so even though it's incredibly well made I gotta put it in Flop because I am really just over the oh look how the gays suffer movies yeah so sorry

okay we just had to do a little cut because the hard drive wanted to crap out right where we're getting to the end of it 

so next up priscilla queen of the desert which I'm gonna put into Fierce because how can I not put it into fears again talked about this in the camp video which is like two hours long but you should totally go watch it cause like nobody did priscilla is hilarious I find that a lot of americans don't find it funny and I wonder if it's like a uh there's a disconnect between american comedy and comedy from all the commonwealth nathan nathan's nations like the uk and ireland and and canada and australia and new zealand america's comedy is kind of different you've got a great performance from hugo weaving before the matrix and lord of the rings you got a great performance from guy pierce before like memento and stuff like that and guy pierce is just like totally sexy the entire time he's on screen and a great performance from terence stamp who is playing again a man playing a trans woman but considering the time when which this movie was made that was kind of brave I hate saying that that it was brave but you know it could have been like a career killer at the time but he just did it so well and but you know if this movie was made today I would be like demanding that that character be played by a trans person considering it's like almost 30 years old I kind of have to look at it with that framing of how many movies had trans characters who were wholly sympathetic at that time and this one does have a wholly sympathetic trans character and so I'm like okay me a cis person will forgive you for that but if you're trans I totally get it if you'd like to hate the movie I totally get it

next we have the rocky horror picture show which is so many people's first queer movie I think I've got to put it in Fierce again because it is it's so good I mean it's bad but it's so good it you know introduced the world to tim curry so that alone is worth putting it in fears it inspired generations upon generations of baby drag queens I know that some of the lyrics are problematic sweet transvestite from transsexual transylvania but it's it is pure camp and the thing is the movie is very aware that it's problematic you know not trying to say that any of these people are great people because even it like acknowledges that brad and janet are boring and not entirely against the idea of cheating on each other with the right sweet transvestite or kind of newly born sexy man so yeah I love rocky horror um I'm kind of tempted to move it up to Slay to be honest yeah it has to it's iconic it's an iconic queer movie it has to

next we have Stonewall directed by roland emmerich best known for anonymous and also independence day and that god-awful godzilla movie he is gay and he wanted to make a movie that would kind of tell the historical story of Stonewall from the point of view of a midwestern blonde white boy who happened to be there and started the gay revolution um instead of the people who were actually there fighting the cops who were trans women and lesbians and uh people of color whereas all the white men were you know screening away so that they could go back to their office jobs the next day it's Honestly, Homophobic epitomizes all of the negative stuff I've been talking about in this video everything that's in Flop and Honestly, Homophobic is kind of right there in Stonewall and it's so weird that because Stonewall wanted to be the gay movie it wanted to be you know the gay Oscar movie and it was just bad like not just the content like badly it was badly made it was it erased so many trans characters it erased characters of color maybe with the best intentions but roland know your limitations don't try and win an Oscar speaking of Oscars the favorite which is going immediately into slay because the favorite is one of the best movies made in the last like 20 years it is fantastic olivia coleman is just iconic in this movie I started watching it knowing that everyone was kind of like over the moon about it I didn't know there were lesbians in it and I started watching it I was like oh is this are they is it oh oh oh I adore olivia coleman now I've always loved emma stone and rachel vice and then olivia coleman comes on the screen and it's just like oh this is magical the cinematography is beautiful and the costumes and everything and you know I'll watch anything with nicholas holt in it and him just being a dumbass during the entire movie is great and duck racing have you ever seen ducks race if it's in the movie you should see it uh the kids are all right I'm gonna the kids are all right is basically um two lesbian moms are dealing with kind of their kids meeting their biological father and you know it's it's it's fine it's fine it's not like revolutionary or anything the performances are good the directing is good the script is good but it's not like oh you have to rush out and watch this right now

unlike the next movie the old guard which is absolutely going into Fierce because I would put it in Slay but the main characters aren't queer but just watching the movie and then suddenly there's two guys in the background cuddling and then you have this profession of love from one of them and it's just like from one of them to the other and it's like oh my god I love this where has this been in every action movie ever why is this just happening now and the action in it is unbelievable amazing action again Charlize Theron because she is ally supreme and I just I I loved it it was fantastic I talked about it in the yuri on ice video oddly and it's just such a good movie the hilarious thing was nobody was talking about joe and nicki being gay because although it is it's obvious you know they have that scene where they you know profess their love to each other everything else in the movie was so good and it's kind of this you know gay people were talking about joe and nicky but straight people were like this movie's badass and it's like hollywood see when you make a really good movie and there are gay characters in it and you don't make a big deal about their being gay characters in it they just exist like we do in real life people don't make a big deal about their being gay characters in it because the people watch the movie and they're like this is awesome and then you have everyone saying this is an awesome movie and then the bigots are too afraid to get ripped apart on twitter so they don't say anything bad about it so to certain studios who keep trying to make their being gay characters in a movie the biggest pressed tour event in the world stop doing that

next we have some more much needed sapphic representation with carol which is not a happy movie by any means but really good and one of those movies that's just like some of the best performances I've ever seen from Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett and it's so rare to see a movie about queer people taking place in that time frame in that you know that late 50s early 60s kind of hoop skirt housewife kind of era and to kind of show just what it was like to be not just gay but to be a gay woman at that time because you were a part of two minorities that were basically considered powerless and worthless like women were only good for making babies so if you were a lesbian well your one utility in the world was gone so what's the use of you at all and that's kind of the outlook that people had at the time so being a lesbian was really worse than being a gay man because if you were a gay man at least you could still you know I don't know lift a hammer and build something or something like that but for lesbians it was like you have no use to us you know the movie does not shy away from saying that and one of Cate Blanchett's best performances

rent 2005. when rent first came out it was like my favorite movie ever because it came out at a time I had just gotten my first digital video camera and I was just starting to make movies uh like movies that I was actually editing and stuff I started making movies when I was in the sixth grade but I was in the 11th grade at this time and I had just gotten my first digital video camera and I was making movies and editing and experimenting and doing stuff like that and the whole idea of no but no day but today and be creative and all of that just really was very important to me and then I watched it again I didn't watch it for probably a decade and I just had really fond memories of it because it came up came to me at a time in my life that I have very fond memories of because I'm a gay who has fond memories of high school because I'm weird like that because I watched lindsey ellis's video tearing rent apart and I was like no rent is amazing what are you talking about you crazy woman what are you talking about and then I rewatched it and I was like maybe I'm the crazy one when I watched the movie originally I really identified with mark and when I watched it the 10 years later I wanted to beat him with that camera everything in it just I mean just go watch lindsay's video on it and I am eventually going to make a video talking about rent because it is necessary some of the musical numbers are like supreme like awesome like fantastic I love them I will put on take me or leave me and I will belt for four minutes straight but I've gotta put it in Flop because it is so much gen x angst and as a millennial I can't I cannot accept that anymore mark is offered like a sixty thousand dollar a year part-time job filming videos and he quits and this takes place in the late 80s Flop it's a Flop but it was also a Flop at the box office

so last but certainly not least angels in america talking about the movie but also the play because there is a pro-shot version of the play that you can check out and it's totally worth it because andrew garfield is in it and I love andrew garfield angels in america subtitled a gay fantasia on national themes and it's very gay it deals with a lot of very kind of philosophical things you know has god abandoned us rise of the aids crisis questions of identity it and and lots of gay characters none of which are actually played by gay actors I think but that's fine because the movie is amazing it's one of the rare movies that is very willing to say just how the reagan administration was when it came to aids it is as a movie the hbo movie it was technically a mini series so it is six hours long so it is a commitment but it is worth every minute and you can watch it in hour long chunks because it was originally aired as six episodes so angels in america the last entry in this tier making thing that I'm doing is going into slay we're ending on a high note instead of rent which would not be ending on a high note despite it being a musical and unlike rent which I don't want to say completely ignored how terrible aids was angels in america does not shy away from pointing out how horrible the aids crisis was that it's not just oh you get sick and eventually die through the character of roy cohn and through the character of prior walter you see how horrible that diagnosis was what it did to your body and why it would kind of make you question the existence of god and when you're kind of in that situation where you're questioning it and then literal angels start coming to you you know what does that do to your mindset

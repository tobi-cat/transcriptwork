00:00:00:04 - 00:00:18:01
Speaker 1
I enjoy naked in the sights of your body running through my head. It's hard to escape the past. Every time I say something, I really want to take it back. Sensitive. I'm peeling back my skin.

00:00:18:05 - 00:00:19:09
Speaker 2
Get damaged by.

00:00:20:19 - 00:00:39:02
James Somerton
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the inaugural episode of Going In Raw, where we watch a movie and then immediately give you our live reactions to it. The first movie we were talking about actually wasn't on the list because we just decided to watch it and have this be the opening episode. And that first movie is Nimona. And now I'm going to let Nick talk.

00:00:39:02 - 00:00:39:12
James Somerton
Hi, Nick.

00:00:39:15 - 00:00:47:05
Nick Herrgott
Hi, I'm Nick. And everything that happened, everything that James is saying is true.

00:00:47:06 - 00:00:48:22
James Somerton
It is true. It is.

00:00:49:09 - 00:00:50:08
Speaker 2
True. It is.

00:00:50:08 - 00:00:50:21
James Somerton
In fact.

00:00:50:21 - 00:00:52:07
Speaker 2
Go figure!

00:00:52:07 - 00:01:05:06
James Somerton
In fact, fact. So yeah, the-the idea of this podcast is that it is for patrons and YouTube members and that we will watch a movie.

00:01:05:13 - 00:01:07:15
Nick Herrgott
Content, we will watch a content.

00:01:07:22 - 00:01:20:04
James Somerton
A content that we have either never seen before, at least one of us has never seen before, or we haven't seen in a very long time and watch it and then immediately record our thoughts.

00:01:20:04 - 00:01:23:11
Nick Herrgott
Give our unadulterated thoughts. Because when James and I normally watch.

00:01:23:13 - 00:01:24:06
Speaker 2
Thoughts.

00:01:24:23 - 00:01:37:05
Nick Herrgott
And James and I normally watch a movie, TV show or whatever, we talk about it for eons before it ends up appearing in a video. So this is this is our raw thoughts about that. Yeah, we haven't we haven't discussed it at all.

00:01:37:05 - 00:01:58:14
James Somerton
We'll leave a movie theater and just like blabber for the entire drive back to wherever we live. So we just watched Nimona, which is available on Netflix and is and is in some theaters and so do you want to kind of give an idea of what Nimona is?

00:01:58:23 - 00:02:00:07
Nick Herrgott
So are we going to do spoilers?

00:02:05:01 - 00:02:09:04
Nick Herrgott
I mean, it's hard it'll be hard to kind of to fill the time without giving spoilers.

00:02:09:04 - 00:02:15:13
James Somerton
Yeah, it's not. It's not it's not the type of movie that if you know how it ends, it's going to ruin it for you.

00:02:15:13 - 00:02:16:07
Nick Herrgott
It's it's little.

00:02:16:09 - 00:02:18:09
James Somerton
We don't need to talk about the ending ending.

00:02:18:09 - 00:02:26:20
Nick Herrgott
Plot wise it's literally every animated. Yeah and show TV what it's it's it's the format and that and that's okay.

00:02:26:21 - 00:02:32:00
James Somerton
So basically a night who is lower born a dude who's lower.

00:02:32:00 - 00:02:41:00
Nick Herrgott
But first of all we have to set the setting. So this is a world where there is a society that is surrounded by walls that are terrified of monsters outside the walls. Think attack of Titan, but for kids.

00:02:41:08 - 00:02:41:16
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:02:44:08 - 00:02:46:14
James Somerton
So yeah. So it takes place in that kind of society.

00:02:46:14 - 00:02:54:03
Nick Herrgott
And there's a kind of you kind of equated it to a religion of lifting up certain individuals to this this well, there's this.

00:02:54:03 - 00:02:57:23
James Somerton
There's this huge hero worship for this.

00:02:58:21 - 00:02:59:14
Nick Herrgott
The first night.

00:02:59:17 - 00:03:18:17
James Somerton
The first night who, you know, she slayed this monster a thousand years ago. And now every so often, new knights are added to the sort of regimen of knighthood. But they're all honorable, Sean. They're all like, Highborn. Yeah. And the first one that becomes a knight who isn't.

00:03:18:17 - 00:03:22:19
Nick Herrgott
Highborn This is cause for controversy.

00:03:22:22 - 00:03:32:18
James Somerton
Yes, lots of people are not happy about this. And he is framed for the murder of the queen. And so he has to figure out how to, you know.

00:03:32:18 - 00:03:33:04
Nick Herrgott
Clear his.

00:03:33:04 - 00:03:35:11
James Somerton
Name and in doing so meets.

00:03:35:11 - 00:03:36:10
Nick Herrgott
This encounter.

00:03:36:11 - 00:03:38:22
James Somerton
Crazy ass being called the Mona.

00:03:39:04 - 00:03:41:18
Nick Herrgott
An impish young lady. Occasionally.

00:03:42:12 - 00:03:43:10
James Somerton
Sometimes a boy.

00:03:43:10 - 00:03:48:05
Nick Herrgott
Today, a boy today. I called her immediately, like, Oh, that's the monster.

00:03:48:12 - 00:03:48:20
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:03:49:18 - 00:04:05:13
Nick Herrgott
So, like, spoilers, like this is a first act thing, so don't even feel bad, but we are going to get the spoiler, so be careful. And she sets out on a quest with him initially because he she thinks that he's out to sort of topple the establishment government and you know.

00:04:05:19 - 00:04:07:12
James Somerton
Which needs some toppling which.

00:04:07:14 - 00:04:12:02
Nick Herrgott
Which she believes is in need of some toppling. Yeah, probably more toppling that is needed.

00:04:12:10 - 00:04:12:20
Speaker 2
Yes.

00:04:14:09 - 00:04:19:13
Nick Herrgott
But he's out to clear his name and so she's like, okay, well, clear your name and then we'll be friends. And then he's like, Deal.

00:04:20:06 - 00:04:29:22
James Somerton
For everyone listening. I just adjusted the volume a little bit. I hope that's all right. I think I did. I adjusted, I did something. I did something. But yeah, continue.

00:04:29:22 - 00:04:57:07
Nick Herrgott
James Summerton Channel Audio Problems Trademark new audio recorder. So a little bit of slack. So they set out on a quest to figure out what's going on to clear his name and, you know, haphazard, circumstantial evidence. Zach, in a moment, it's all there. But yeah, it's perfectly fine because it's very it's about the characters and their interactions and what's trying to say, Yeah, I read earlier that pneumonia as a trans allegory.

00:04:57:09 - 00:05:06:08
James Somerton
And I didn't, I didn't sort of I hadn't I knew nothing about this going on and I knew lots of people said that it was like really gay. And I was like, okay, it's gay. Like Luca.

00:05:06:12 - 00:05:09:16
Nick Herrgott
I didn't hear about the gay stuff. I heard about the trans allegory stuff.

00:05:09:16 - 00:05:12:11
James Somerton
Okay? So I heard that it was that it was gay.

00:05:12:12 - 00:05:15:02
Nick Herrgott
And like, right for first scene, it's gay. Yeah.

00:05:15:12 - 00:05:17:12
Speaker 2
They kiss the kiss.

00:05:17:20 - 00:05:19:06
James Somerton
Not at the beginning, but at the end. They kiss.

00:05:20:00 - 00:05:22:01
Nick Herrgott
But at the beginning they're holding hands and it's like.

00:05:22:08 - 00:05:32:12
James Somerton
Resting on each other. And like, I thought, it's very apparent. I was like, okay, it's gay. Like Luke is gay, all right, you're fine or whatever. So I was really kind of shocked when I was like, Oh my God. Oh, but touching it.

00:05:32:13 - 00:05:39:11
Nick Herrgott
But no, I mean, a major plot point of the entire series is that this is kind of like a jilted lover status they fucking like.

00:05:41:00 - 00:05:55:11
James Somerton
And so the main character is gay and his love interest and the main character is voiced by a resumed who doesn't get nearly enough work. And his love interest is played by Eugene Liang, who is Eugene from the Dry Guys.

00:05:56:07 - 00:05:57:21
Nick Herrgott
The group formerly known as the Dry Guys.

00:05:58:04 - 00:05:59:12
James Somerton
Yeah, I don't really think they're.

00:05:59:18 - 00:06:01:14
Nick Herrgott
They don't really dry, literally dry much anymore.

00:06:01:19 - 00:06:02:02
James Somerton
They don't.

00:06:04:02 - 00:06:05:13
Nick Herrgott
One guy tried to apologize.

00:06:05:15 - 00:06:07:01
Speaker 2
That didn't work out right.

00:06:09:16 - 00:06:22:07
James Somerton
And they and so there's this like, you know and he's basically a cop. Yeah. And so he's like, I've got to, you know, take him in whether I love him or not. I have to find him and, you know, bring him to justice.

00:06:22:07 - 00:06:26:13
Nick Herrgott
And there's some serious I was like, meet after me off the bat, like, don't take him back.

00:06:27:02 - 00:06:27:08
James Somerton
Oh, yeah.

00:06:27:08 - 00:06:30:12
Speaker 2
You do not like you were pissed. But that's kind of.

00:06:30:12 - 00:06:34:16
Nick Herrgott
My ending point, is that, you know, they do get back together at the end. And I was like, Now na na.

00:06:34:16 - 00:06:36:01
Speaker 2
Now there.

00:06:36:11 - 00:06:39:12
Nick Herrgott
There was some betrayed trust. On several occasions I.

00:06:39:14 - 00:06:53:08
James Somerton
There was, there was much betrayed trust. Yeah. I just assumed that, you know, between the, the, the ending and then the ending ending where you see them back together, it was like kind of something had happened, you know, they kind of.

00:06:54:10 - 00:06:58:14
Nick Herrgott
Parted ways, but, you know, they want to have gay representations. They need to have happy gays and not, you know.

00:06:59:00 - 00:07:20:00
James Somerton
Which I, I want to Netflix. There's lots of stuff that pisses a lot of people off. I want to give them some props for actually making this movie because it was supposed to be a Disney movie and it was in pre-production at Disney. I think it may have actually been in production and Bob Chapek took over and axed it.

00:07:21:10 - 00:07:25:03
James Somerton
It was then picked up for production by Annapurna Pictures.

00:07:25:06 - 00:07:28:04
Nick Herrgott
Which is another A24 esque arthouse.

00:07:28:04 - 00:07:42:05
James Somerton
Yeah, Annapurna Pictures is basically it's run by Megan Ellison. Her dad, like, owns Nike, so he's like super rich and he gave her a bunch of money and said, Do something with your life. Here's money I'm not giving you anymore. Yeah. And she became a film producer and she's been amazing, you know?

00:07:42:05 - 00:07:42:23
Nick Herrgott
Wasn't that Laker?

00:07:43:16 - 00:07:45:07
James Somerton
Both of them. They're like sister.

00:07:45:10 - 00:07:46:22
Nick Herrgott
Wow. They have. That's a family.

00:07:46:22 - 00:08:01:14
James Somerton
Yeah, Like David that worked. And so she does really Annapurna Pictures does really interesting movies. And so they did this. Netflix bought it. I don't know if they bought it or if they finished it, whatever it might have been. But like big props to Netflix for.

00:08:01:15 - 00:08:01:20
Nick Herrgott
Yeah.

00:08:01:20 - 00:08:06:19
James Somerton
So we're getting this out on Pride Month but bad props to Netflix for not advertising it more.

00:08:06:19 - 00:08:17:08
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, well that's how it goes So word of mouth spread it. But yeah Nimona herself, the character is definitely a trans allegory. What's the deal is she's not a typical monster. She's a shapeshifter.

00:08:17:08 - 00:08:20:22
James Somerton
Which I don't know. If I don't know, I would say genderqueer because, like, she like.

00:08:21:08 - 00:08:25:03
Nick Herrgott
We were getting there. They literally we were getting there because.

00:08:25:03 - 00:08:26:19
James Somerton
They literally, literally like, boy.

00:08:26:19 - 00:08:27:20
Speaker 2
Today, literally.

00:08:27:20 - 00:08:33:00
Nick Herrgott
Every non-binary person in the world is like, what superpower would you pick shapes after like.

00:08:33:00 - 00:08:33:05
Speaker 2
That?

00:08:33:05 - 00:08:48:04
Nick Herrgott
That's, that's the thing. It's like, no, I'm very non-binary nonbinary and trans guys with rats like right. Nobody knows why. I mean, with shape terms, it's a little bit more clear because you get to be more whimsical with like gender and sort of fluidity and stuff. Yeah, And.

00:08:48:21 - 00:08:55:03
James Somerton
And they're very like, like they shift into armadillos and a whale.

00:08:57:07 - 00:08:58:17
Nick Herrgott
Like, I like the shark. The shark.

00:08:58:17 - 00:09:05:18
James Somerton
Was nice. Oh, the surface adorable. But the the asshole Nate, who was just, like, constantly scared about the whale showing up again. Just kind of.

00:09:06:00 - 00:09:07:08
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, that was that was like.

00:09:07:09 - 00:09:08:05
James Somerton
That tickled me.

00:09:08:08 - 00:09:08:19
Speaker 2
Um.

00:09:09:18 - 00:09:24:10
Nick Herrgott
So the thing about, like, Nimona being, like, a trans allegory is because a lot of the lines directed at trans people, like what are yes, there was a lot of that coded language, not so coded language kind of put in there like.

00:09:24:20 - 00:09:44:23
James Somerton
Like asking like, what are you why can't you just be this? Yeah, like a lot of that and not even coming from like a malicious place, but just like, asking, like, why can't you just be normal and, like, her getting really upset at that? Yeah, because you can tell she's been asked that for a long time and she's over it now.

00:09:45:00 - 00:09:48:09
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not the first person to ask this question, sir.

00:09:48:10 - 00:09:48:16
Speaker 2
Like, Yeah.

00:09:48:23 - 00:09:57:07
James Somerton
She like, congratulations. You ask the question I've been asked for the last thousand years. Bravo. So like. And also she's a thousand years old.

00:09:57:08 - 00:10:03:19
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, she's least old. Yeah, at least it seemed like she was around the pond by the time she started turning into humans.

00:10:03:23 - 00:10:05:06
James Somerton
Yeah, that's. Yeah.

00:10:05:16 - 00:10:07:06
Nick Herrgott
And one question I came away from with.

00:10:07:06 - 00:10:09:17
James Somerton
All those that she didn't turn into a human until she first saw.

00:10:09:17 - 00:10:13:07
Nick Herrgott
One. Yeah, It seems like she only really turns into things when she wants companionship.

00:10:13:07 - 00:10:17:03
James Somerton
Yeah. Which I want a sequel. I want to find out, like, is she some kind of nature spirit? Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:17:10 - 00:10:26:01
Nick Herrgott
What's going on there? Another question I had is like, there's the whole like, it is very attack on Titan. They don't go outside the walls. They. They don't go outside the walls. Yeah.

00:10:26:08 - 00:10:27:20
James Somerton
Because outside the walls are monsters.

00:10:27:20 - 00:10:31:19
Nick Herrgott
And at the end there's an indication that there is now travel outside the walls.

00:10:31:19 - 00:10:34:14
James Somerton
It's an indication they show the wall has been broken.

00:10:34:21 - 00:10:38:01
Nick Herrgott
What I mean by the indications for what purpose are they going outside the walls now?

00:10:38:10 - 00:10:39:12
James Somerton
Yeah. Like obviously this.

00:10:39:12 - 00:10:42:13
Nick Herrgott
Resource acquisition is this like, you know, like is it just shows.

00:10:42:13 - 00:10:48:02
James Somerton
Like that? It is a an open space. Yeah. It's there's nothing outside. Yeah. It's, it's wilderness.

00:10:48:03 - 00:10:57:23
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. That's the, that's the rhetoric is that there are monsters everywhere in the wilderness. Yeah. What I wanted to know is like, was it just the one monster that the. Oh I forgot the, the night lady. Not Glinda.

00:10:58:13 - 00:10:59:10
James Somerton
Nope, not Glinda.

00:10:59:10 - 00:11:00:02
Nick Herrgott
Not Glinda.

00:11:00:16 - 00:11:01:08
Speaker 2
Let me.

00:11:02:00 - 00:11:16:10
Nick Herrgott
It's unimportant the head night lady. Like it's not clear whether she because I would have even read that Nimona and there's night lady encountered later in later in night lady's life where she could properly vanquish this foe with the proper sword. And.

00:11:16:15 - 00:11:27:05
James Somerton
Well, that's what I meant by like, there was a religion around it because spoilers for a bit later on you find out that you know the legend that you heard.

00:11:27:05 - 00:11:29:07
Nick Herrgott
At the very end of the night vanquishing the monster.

00:11:29:07 - 00:11:31:09
James Somerton
Was really two little girls.

00:11:31:09 - 00:11:34:18
Nick Herrgott
Two little girls and one having all decided that the other little girl was a monster.

00:11:34:19 - 00:11:56:20
James Somerton
Yeah, Even though they had been best friends, she decided she was a monster and it was a wooden sword. She didn't, like, vanquish her and everything. But a religion was built up around this myth. Yeah, and I found that really interesting. Just the sort of commentary on, like, how things change in the telling. Yeah.

00:11:56:20 - 00:12:03:21
Nick Herrgott
So for that, like, I, there are two things I had I had about that thought it was you brought it up is the first is like are there other monsters in this world.

00:12:04:04 - 00:12:08:06
James Somerton
Yeah like art because in the end the monster she turns into is really cool. It's very.

00:12:08:06 - 00:12:17:01
Nick Herrgott
Miyazaki. Like, is she the only like, this was a mix of attack on Titan and Miyazaki. Know that specific Miyazaki movie? Princess Mononoke?

00:12:17:08 - 00:12:17:18
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:12:18:20 - 00:12:24:00
Nick Herrgott
So, like, I also want to know, like, did Nimona and her blond and Blondie.

00:12:25:06 - 00:12:25:19
James Somerton
Blondie.

00:12:26:06 - 00:12:39:10
Nick Herrgott
Glinda, Lady Knight lending her name Galadriel or Gloria? Laura. Gloria did they re encounter in a more later more climactic way where you did get these kind of murals of this giant monster.

00:12:39:10 - 00:12:42:21
James Somerton
Kind of yeah Or was it really just for these two little girls.

00:12:42:21 - 00:12:44:05
Nick Herrgott
They can way out of proportion?

00:12:44:05 - 00:12:46:20
James Somerton
Yeah, that it was blown up. You know, given how.

00:12:46:20 - 00:12:55:11
Nick Herrgott
Much pageantry is kind of built up around Gloria, I'd say that there was I would I would have that indicates to me that there would have been another conflict later.

00:12:55:12 - 00:12:57:09
James Somerton
Maybe evenly. And this is just me kind of like.

00:12:57:14 - 00:13:00:15
Nick Herrgott
Not that it really not that it matters. I'm just head canning.

00:13:00:18 - 00:13:18:00
James Somerton
Well, yeah. And it's like I'm sort of spitballing ideas here that maybe even later in life they didn't make up. But like Nimona kind of said, like, I'm going to give you something and pretended to be slain. Yeah, And that created Glau. It's kind of.

00:13:18:05 - 00:13:18:14
Nick Herrgott
That big.

00:13:18:20 - 00:13:19:17
James Somerton
Forever myth.

00:13:20:07 - 00:13:23:10
Nick Herrgott
You know? Just tell your people you can kill me, but tell people to stop hunting.

00:13:23:10 - 00:13:39:01
James Somerton
And maybe it's even. She found out like, wait, like you, your people, you you get old and die. I that doesn't happen to me. The only way you can live forever is if there's, you know, a story about you. Yeah, like something like that. Like, that's. That's sequel fodder.

00:13:39:03 - 00:13:50:11
Nick Herrgott
Hmm. Another thing is, I didn't quite understand how I felt that, you know, Nimona was watching. Oh, the two gay boys gave away.

00:13:50:12 - 00:13:50:21
James Somerton
Boys.

00:13:51:13 - 00:13:52:04
Nick Herrgott
Um.

00:13:52:19 - 00:13:54:20
James Somerton
Let me see. Here. Let me see. I got. I got it.

00:13:54:20 - 00:13:56:14
Nick Herrgott
Golden Loin was one of them. Yes.

00:13:57:07 - 00:13:58:13
James Somerton
Ballester bold hers.

00:13:58:13 - 00:13:59:00
Nick Herrgott
And.

00:13:59:03 - 00:14:01:19
James Somerton
And Ambrosia is golden loin. Yes.

00:14:02:13 - 00:14:04:10
Nick Herrgott
Um, like they kind of.

00:14:04:10 - 00:14:09:18
James Somerton
I love the names. The names are. It's based on a graphic novel, so it's obviously like playing. Yeah. The sort of.

00:14:09:18 - 00:14:32:23
Nick Herrgott
Chivalry they didn't have. They had a similar falling out to Nimona and Glorious. Yeah, I felt like Nimona didn't play off of that enough either in one way or the other. Empathetic or get over him either telling him to get telling Balas to get over him, or kind of sort of, you know, wanting to see how this would play out, you know, And she was certainly sort of a proxy.

00:14:32:23 - 00:14:35:03
Nick Herrgott
I felt that there wasn't enough play with that.

00:14:35:08 - 00:14:47:22
James Somerton
Yeah. Like, I think my only complaint about the movie right now is like I wish there was another half hour of it. Yeah. Because it was a 90 minute movie and I wish it had been 2 hours. Then you could have seen a bit more of the a bit more back and forth.

00:14:47:22 - 00:15:02:04
Nick Herrgott
Like, like I said, I feel like it would have been natural for Nimona, that kind of, you know, from aged excuse me, age and experience, kind of advising people that, no, he's he's not for her, he's not for real. Yeah, he's he's just like all the rest.

00:15:02:04 - 00:15:02:11
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:15:03:02 - 00:15:03:23
Nick Herrgott
This one's different.

00:15:03:23 - 00:15:04:20
Speaker 2
He's a guy.

00:15:07:01 - 00:15:07:18
Nick Herrgott
And then but.

00:15:07:18 - 00:15:09:02
James Somerton
Like, all nightmare bastards.

00:15:10:00 - 00:15:10:20
Speaker 2
With the.

00:15:10:20 - 00:15:12:23
Nick Herrgott
Complexity level of silly.

00:15:12:23 - 00:15:13:08
Speaker 2
Cab.

00:15:14:14 - 00:15:22:06
Nick Herrgott
With the complexity level of She's saying this, but she actually is curious about wanting to know like, is he different? Like, is it. Yeah. Like in another world.

00:15:22:06 - 00:15:24:10
James Somerton
And giving him a shot to be different.

00:15:24:14 - 00:15:30:19
Nick Herrgott
Like in it, but like, you know, being disappointed like, and like sort of what the question like in another world could, could glorify and I have worked out.

00:15:31:01 - 00:15:42:13
James Somerton
Hmm Yeah and kind of seeing and maybe even like seeing that oh they did work out in the end and that kind of gives her like a I could have Yeah, we could have been that.

00:15:42:14 - 00:15:53:06
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. It's sort of just entering, answering the question like, you know, like, okay, I have this burning question answered. I can, you know, I have, you know, unfinished business is finished.

00:15:53:06 - 00:15:53:14
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:15:54:03 - 00:16:02:20
Nick Herrgott
Um, I liked the allusions to trans suicide. Trans and queer suicide. I felt that was just.

00:16:04:04 - 00:16:04:07
Speaker 2
Growing.

00:16:04:09 - 00:16:06:18
Nick Herrgott
Up a little bit. It hit really hard.

00:16:06:19 - 00:16:09:14
James Somerton
Well, yeah, like the the the line was.

00:16:10:00 - 00:16:15:07
Nick Herrgott
I don't know what's worse, whether people are constantly thinking he's a monster or whether I want them to drive, you know, whether whether.

00:16:15:07 - 00:16:21:09
James Somerton
Everyone in the kingdom wants to drive a sword through me or if some or what's worse Yeah sometimes I wish they would.

00:16:21:09 - 00:16:22:07
Nick Herrgott
And then she kind of like.

00:16:22:12 - 00:16:23:18
James Somerton
And then in the end, she.

00:16:23:18 - 00:16:31:19
Nick Herrgott
She props herself up against a giant statue with her heart at the point of a sword sort of aiming to do that. Yeah, I feel bad for spoilers.

00:16:32:11 - 00:16:33:15
James Somerton
Well, we said there would be.

00:16:33:15 - 00:16:36:18
Nick Herrgott
Okay, let's go watch it. It's too late now.

00:16:36:23 - 00:16:54:03
James Somerton
Know like, I got, like, kind of emotional when that was happening because like, yeah, I. For what? I wasn't expecting it to go that hard as a kid. I also like, I mean, I was shocked that there were, you know, guys holding hands, let alone guys kissing in the end. But like, the actual like that wasn't even a suicide allegory.

00:16:54:05 - 00:16:54:15
Nick Herrgott
No, no, no.

00:16:54:15 - 00:16:57:01
James Somerton
Her saying, like, sometimes I wish I was dead.

00:16:57:01 - 00:17:04:20
Nick Herrgott
Exploring the reasons and purposes for queer suicide. And this is something that I've discussed with some people in my personal life about, like why this happens.

00:17:04:20 - 00:17:06:17
James Somerton
But feeling very disconnected from.

00:17:06:17 - 00:17:08:13
Nick Herrgott
Her, different from, you know.

00:17:09:00 - 00:17:09:15
James Somerton
Just being their.

00:17:09:15 - 00:17:12:06
Nick Herrgott
Forms of suicide. Like it's it's, it's.

00:17:12:13 - 00:17:31:17
James Somerton
It's, it's different from the and trigger warning. Yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'll put that in the description. Yeah. That, you know, there is, you know, suicidal ideation from being depressed and stuff like that. But it's when, when you're queer it's not so much just like general depression, it's.

00:17:31:23 - 00:17:34:06
Nick Herrgott
Feel like you don't get it, like you don't belong in the.

00:17:34:06 - 00:17:36:12
James Somerton
World. Yeah. Like there is a targeted depression.

00:17:36:20 - 00:17:45:15
Nick Herrgott
There's no like and again, like, it's like she's been at this for a thousand years. There's no reprise. Literally every when she gets close to distance herself because she's different, she's a monster.

00:17:45:15 - 00:17:45:22
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:17:45:22 - 00:17:52:19
Nick Herrgott
So, you know, it's like, what? Is there a point in continuing? Yeah. And that's kind of the ideology that happens for a lot of, you know, queer people.

00:17:52:22 - 00:18:10:05
James Somerton
Well, yeah, because it it kind of hangs over you. It's not like the depression that everyone says, you know, you'll go to therapy and things will get better. It's like therapy doesn't make this better. The world needs to get better. Yeah, Yeah. And she at that point in the story, like many queer people, are, like, the world's not getting better.

00:18:10:06 - 00:18:10:13
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:18:10:22 - 00:18:17:22
James Somerton
It's like, yeah, there I am not. I've been here for a thousand years and it hasn't gotten better.

00:18:17:22 - 00:18:23:20
Nick Herrgott
Another thing that I liked was the queer rage in regards to, you know, she's had enough. So she goes on a tirade and so.

00:18:23:21 - 00:18:25:16
James Somerton
That when that's when she turns into the.

00:18:25:16 - 00:18:26:18
Nick Herrgott
Kaiju. Yeah, the Chi.

00:18:26:18 - 00:18:27:10
James Somerton
Just like.

00:18:27:10 - 00:18:46:12
Nick Herrgott
And I all I really, really liked that because so many people kind of comment like, Oh, queer people are just so easily triggered. They're just so angry. Yeah, they want to go on there and peop some people that I'm close to say this like they just want to go on tirades for nothing. They're just so centered, they're so just angry, but they're so offended by everything.

00:18:46:12 - 00:18:53:12
Nick Herrgott
And it's like, yeah, you're looking at the fifth act of that. Yeah. You don't know what happened that you're.

00:18:53:12 - 00:19:05:01
James Somerton
Looking at the, you're looking at the Twitter interaction. Yeah. Where you know someone was, you know, called a name. Yeah. You're not looking at the 30 years that led up to that.

00:19:05:01 - 00:19:05:12
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:05:16 - 00:19:07:01
James Somerton
You're not taking that into account.

00:19:07:01 - 00:19:15:15
Nick Herrgott
When you're getting to the point of having that rageful person. And this is why I, you know, Thank you. I dropped my fidget dragon. Um, it.

00:19:15:15 - 00:19:16:14
James Somerton
Doesn't make any noise.

00:19:16:14 - 00:19:30:05
Nick Herrgott
It's perfectly like I give a lot of empathy and, you know, proxy lenience to people who explode on other people online for, you know, like, oh, all I did was ask what pronouns they were using. It's like.

00:19:30:21 - 00:19:33:01
James Somerton
Yeah, but that was the 80th time today.

00:19:33:07 - 00:19:51:07
Nick Herrgott
And especially like, and trans people who are patrons or YouTube members can, you know, kind of chime in on this. But yeah I kind of direction for people when you know they can conflated like I just don't know what to do I'm like look at someone if they visibly look like they are trying to present feminine face she her.

00:19:51:16 - 00:19:54:02
James Somerton
Or just start with they and let them correct you.

00:19:54:09 - 00:20:11:17
Nick Herrgott
That can trigger some uh dysphoria for trans people though, like the kind of back back brain like, oh my God, I mean, not passing like. Yeah, that's so that's why I say if it is very apparent that they're trying to go for feminine use, she her because even if it's a guy, even if it's a guy in drag, you're like, ooh, I'm fishy.

00:20:11:23 - 00:20:12:11
Speaker 2
Like, yeah.

00:20:12:17 - 00:20:13:06
Nick Herrgott
So like.

00:20:13:16 - 00:20:14:23
James Somerton
Ooh, I'm Courtney Act tonight.

00:20:14:23 - 00:20:16:09
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'm.

00:20:16:09 - 00:20:38:14
Nick Herrgott
Serving Courtney If it looks if they look like they're presenting as masculine used masculine pronouns Yeah it's and I can't quite if it's androgynous if, if it's just a guy with a beard in a skirt use they Yeah. If you are wrong they will correctly correct you. But the important part is it needs to look like you're trying to try.

00:20:38:15 - 00:20:42:08
Nick Herrgott
If you see a guy who is, you know, someone who is.

00:20:42:12 - 00:20:43:13
James Somerton
You know, and you might see they've.

00:20:43:13 - 00:20:48:08
Nick Herrgott
Got masculine features, they've got make, but they've got makeup on, they've got a bit of a shadow and.

00:20:48:17 - 00:21:11:18
James Somerton
Look, honestly, like in that kind of situation, like even if it's a situation where it's like someone who is like 100% femme, like just like got the six inch stilettos, like is wearing a miniskirt and everything. And you say she they are very likely to happily correct you as they or he. Yeah, they're not going to get offended because because they know what they're serving.

00:21:11:18 - 00:21:23:18
Nick Herrgott
You know what they're serving. You know, people don't people don't get dressed in and dress dressed up in the dark like, yeah, you know, people look at themselves in the mirror when they get dressed. They know what their clothes are. They know what their wardrobe is.

00:21:23:18 - 00:21:24:01
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:21:24:23 - 00:21:44:00
Nick Herrgott
And like I said, if that's not what they're going for, they'll correct you what the element of when it looks like you're, quote unquote, not trying to do this is when you're trying too hard to correct the other direction. You see that person, they've got the shadow, they've got, you know, so so makeup on, masculine features, broad shoulders, but they're still wearing the dress and the full face of makeup anyway.

00:21:44:00 - 00:21:46:10
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. And you say he like it's like, okay, what.

00:21:46:16 - 00:21:47:21
James Somerton
They are trying their.

00:21:47:21 - 00:21:59:02
Nick Herrgott
Best. What what direction are they going in? Either they're trying their best or they're putting on a pass. Either way, if they're putting on a fast and saying she her, that's going to be endearment. Even if they know like, oh honey, you think I'm passing?

00:22:00:12 - 00:22:01:05
James Somerton
Not today.

00:22:03:10 - 00:22:05:12
Speaker 2
But thank thank you. Bless your heart.

00:22:05:12 - 00:22:08:20
James Somerton
Like I've been in this since 5 p.m. last.

00:22:08:20 - 00:22:09:04
Speaker 2
Time.

00:22:11:11 - 00:22:18:11
James Somerton
I've done two shows, Anna and a matinee. Okay he's he's closing a bathroom door.

00:22:18:17 - 00:22:21:15
Nick Herrgott
Bathroom door. Oh, God. I bumped into. Okay.

00:22:21:20 - 00:22:22:07
Speaker 2
Okay.

00:22:22:14 - 00:22:24:17
James Somerton
Yeah, The bathroom door closed properly.

00:22:25:04 - 00:22:25:13
Nick Herrgott
Yeah.

00:22:25:15 - 00:22:41:18
James Somerton
Okay. But yeah, like, so for the movie, I. I was so shocked watching the movie just how nonchalantly queer it was. Yeah. How at no point was it like, message. Message Like this night to homophobe? It's like, No, he's actually just an ass, so.

00:22:41:18 - 00:22:42:23
Nick Herrgott
He's just an asshole.

00:22:42:23 - 00:22:44:22
James Somerton
Yeah, he's. He's just a douche nozzle.

00:22:44:22 - 00:22:48:05
Nick Herrgott
Like, if you can still be not homophobic and just be an asshole.

00:22:48:05 - 00:22:50:18
James Somerton
Yeah, it was like, Yeah, they're gay. Nobody gives a fuck.

00:22:50:18 - 00:22:51:12
Nick Herrgott
Nobody cares.

00:22:51:16 - 00:23:00:10
James Somerton
Like, there is no issue brought up about it. It's like if if you're if you're a four year old and you're watching this movie, it's oh, those two nights are holding hands.

00:23:00:10 - 00:23:05:07
Nick Herrgott
Because the thing is, society has been conditioned to fear monsters. They don't give a crap who you kiss.

00:23:05:12 - 00:23:07:01
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:23:07:01 - 00:23:22:09
Nick Herrgott
That's the things. And there's like a this is a broader sense of what you could talk about and kind of my crusade recently is like, people just need something to be afraid of. Yeah. So they're going to pick something. And that's why this kind of LGB movement is not going to work, because the objective.

00:23:22:09 - 00:23:24:08
James Somerton
Quiet since the Supreme Court had the.

00:23:24:09 - 00:23:36:20
Nick Herrgott
Objective is to be afraid of people. The objective is to find someone to hate is unity through hatred. Yeah. Um. And it doesn't matter who. If someone's been stamped down, they're going to look for something else.

00:23:37:04 - 00:23:48:09
James Somerton
Oh, yeah. Like, if, you know, like, right now, you know, there's that meme going around, like we got rid of the non binaries and the trans is and everything. Who's next. And it's the look, it's like.

00:23:48:09 - 00:23:51:03
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, it's, it's the maga hat guy kind of looking and just like.

00:23:51:12 - 00:23:52:16
James Somerton
Uh, who's the.

00:23:52:16 - 00:23:56:03
Nick Herrgott
Anarchist look the unicorn like, Yeah, yeah. Adam Schlesinger That comic, I think. Right.

00:23:56:07 - 00:23:56:16
James Somerton
I'm not.

00:23:56:16 - 00:23:57:08
Nick Herrgott
Sure. Okay.

00:23:57:12 - 00:24:03:07
James Somerton
But it's, it's, it's like gone viral because like, people are just like, this is going to happen. This is going to happen. And then the horrible.

00:24:03:07 - 00:24:08:08
Nick Herrgott
Thing is that that happened before any of this was under discussion in the Supreme Court.

00:24:09:00 - 00:24:29:03
James Somerton
Oh, yeah. And like everybody knew everybody knew it was going to happen. And now it is. And, you know, it's it is happening. This is it is honestly, to me, I think. And, you know, it's horrible that this happened with the Supreme Court. I hate that America is going through such a shitstorm right now, especially after like the Obama years where it seemed like things were getting better.

00:24:29:03 - 00:24:31:01
Nick Herrgott
Americans deserve better than America.

00:24:31:04 - 00:24:46:04
James Somerton
They did. I tweeted something close to that, but that it's like all you gays. And we're like, fuck the trans is fuck trans people, fuck trans people, nonbinary people, fuck them. Fucking fuck them. Yeah. How'd the Supreme Court take down?

00:24:46:05 - 00:24:46:14
Nick Herrgott
Yeah.

00:24:46:22 - 00:24:51:10
James Somerton
They took down you. They? Yeah. Like, yeah, the hate. The trans cases haven't come yet.

00:24:51:15 - 00:24:57:15
Nick Herrgott
Hmm. Yours did. But this was always going to happen. Yeah, this was all we put out. A video of several.

00:24:57:23 - 00:24:59:12
Speaker 2
Multiple one of you.

00:24:59:12 - 00:25:07:13
Nick Herrgott
All complaining that we're too negative lately. It's like we were kind of. We're too homophobic. One homosexual man in a person, vaguely.

00:25:08:18 - 00:25:09:08
Speaker 2
In a vague.

00:25:09:08 - 00:25:10:18
James Somerton
And a vague and insane shape.

00:25:11:13 - 00:25:11:18
Speaker 2
Of a.

00:25:11:18 - 00:25:12:10
Nick Herrgott
Person.

00:25:12:17 - 00:25:13:06
Speaker 2
We're having a.

00:25:13:06 - 00:25:14:19
Nick Herrgott
Mental breakdown from over here.

00:25:14:19 - 00:25:18:06
Speaker 2
Being like, just like both.

00:25:18:06 - 00:25:36:00
Nick Herrgott
Of us. So much of our dreams are kind of wrapped up in this vague idea of America. Like you have your Hollywood, Hollywood. It's impossible to publish in Canada. So of course I want to be tethered to America because that's where a large audiences and yeah, you know, like, you know, Marina Diamandis once said, I'm obsessed with the mess that's America.

00:25:37:06 - 00:25:55:09
Nick Herrgott
I don't I feel bad. And, you know, once again, followers chime in because I really don't know. I've kind of gotten a little bit of terrified out of her. Mm. I don't know. I don't want to assume that about her because she's been such a sweetheart for the rest of her career. But yeah, whenever more recent albums, there were a few lyrics in there and I was like, Mm hmm.

00:25:55:09 - 00:26:00:23
Nick Herrgott
Like, and I can see, like, there is a way you could be coming from this that is supportive, but this also could be a dog whistle.

00:26:01:00 - 00:26:03:11
James Somerton
Well, it's always it's always you never know.

00:26:03:18 - 00:26:06:18
Nick Herrgott
And I want to give her the benefit of the doubt. That's the thing. Because I think that well.

00:26:06:18 - 00:26:17:17
James Somerton
That's that's kind of what happened with Bette Midler is Bette Midler said some terrific stuff and a lot of people were like, you know, canceled. But oddly, a lot of trans people were like, give her a minute.

00:26:17:17 - 00:26:18:02
Nick Herrgott
Yeah.

00:26:18:10 - 00:26:21:07
James Somerton
And then she immediately came out was like, well, I'm a fucking idiot, really?

00:26:21:10 - 00:26:28:23
Nick Herrgott
Because Bette Midler has a history of, like, being a loud mouth. Yeah. Like saying things before she really realizes it and then realizing, Oh, well, I have been correct.

00:26:28:23 - 00:26:43:19
James Somerton
And as far as I know, she's corrective incorrect. She has really reversed everything that she said before Hocus Pocus two came out. She didn't say anything like Rowling ask anything like that. It was just like it was like.

00:26:44:10 - 00:26:53:03
Nick Herrgott
But it's one of those things. Phrasing. Yeah, it's one of those things like there needs to be a specific word for this. Aside from dog whistling, it's like, I could read this either way in this person, I don't know.

00:26:53:03 - 00:26:53:16
Speaker 2
Like, yeah.

00:26:53:20 - 00:27:06:13
James Somerton
And it's like, you know, Bette Midler is and has been an ally for a very long time. And it is so, you know, it's figuring out like who's being malicious and who's just who's being so flippant.

00:27:06:13 - 00:27:10:01
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, you and I are both very flippant people.

00:27:10:04 - 00:27:17:17
James Somerton
Yeah. And I've said things on stream and people in the chat are immediately like, James, you want to take that back?

00:27:18:18 - 00:27:20:06
Nick Herrgott
I been there for that.

00:27:20:06 - 00:27:28:04
James Somerton
So it's nothing like super duper offensive. It's mostly just like, like, like just talking too much.

00:27:28:08 - 00:27:28:17
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:27:29:06 - 00:27:41:10
Nick Herrgott
So like, like I saying, I was like, what the Mrs. America like, so, like, I a multiple of my book ideas take place in America and like, I don't really know how to respond to that with America kind of falling apart the way that it is.

00:27:41:11 - 00:27:41:17
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:27:42:02 - 00:27:44:18
Nick Herrgott
Um, aside from just, you know, keep checking on.

00:27:45:08 - 00:28:07:01
James Somerton
Well, yeah. And, you know, it's with Nimona in it, it's oddly timely because, you know, it's this story of a large group of people just looking for something to be afraid of. Yeah. And the power structure saying, let's give you something to be afraid of. Because if you're afraid, it's so much easier for.

00:28:07:01 - 00:28:18:17
Nick Herrgott
Us to not control. But she kind of becomes the monster that they accuse her of. Yeah, because she's just pushed into that territory like there's nothing else to do, which is actually kind of a theme of the next novel in my book.

00:28:18:17 - 00:28:20:18
Speaker 2
But it's the next couple.

00:28:21:23 - 00:28:29:05
James Somerton
And I do have to say Chloe Grace Moretz, who voiced Nimona. Yeah, Yeah. You know. 30 Rock alum.

00:28:29:17 - 00:28:40:07
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, she was the queen of fortune for a brief time, so there was contention between her and Boxy. And then I couldn't really I didn't stick around for Jane for long enough to figure out who won that I've.

00:28:40:07 - 00:28:56:05
James Somerton
Never been on Fortune. It's but she did she did such a good job with the voice work. Everyone did it. I was I was really shocked when I was going through the credits because I didn't I didn't realize it was Eugene from the dry guys. First of all, I was like, Oh, he can be really good voice actor.

00:28:57:12 - 00:29:01:22
Nick Herrgott
Well, I kind of felt he was the weaker of the collection. There were a few line deliveries.

00:29:02:05 - 00:29:15:19
James Somerton
And the thing is, like, I've watched a lot of try guys videos. It didn't, it wasn't him. Yeah, like it wasn't his personality. RuPaul and and Indya Moore have voiced cameos as news broadcasters. I was like, Wow, they cleared the hell out of this.

00:29:15:19 - 00:29:28:14
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. And so, like, they weren't trying to make it ambiguous. They were doing, you know, queer in front of and behind the camera. They were doing allegory. This was allegorical trans representation. Okay, good. We got this. Let's not keep going with allegory.

00:29:29:06 - 00:29:37:09
James Somerton
Yeah, actual right. It's like, okay, there is an allegorical trans representation. We're not going to do allegorical gay representation. So boys kissing.

00:29:37:09 - 00:29:39:00
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, we don't need that anymore.

00:29:39:00 - 00:29:51:09
James Somerton
Like, it's like, Come on, come on. It's 20, 23. Jesus Christ. Yeah. And it was just really shocking. Like, there's been so much good animation this year with Puss in Boots and Spider-Man.

00:29:51:10 - 00:29:53:10
Nick Herrgott
An American animation renaissance.

00:29:53:11 - 00:29:58:22
James Somerton
Like, I think animation American animation is finally saying, we don't have to just be for.

00:29:58:22 - 00:29:59:09
Nick Herrgott
Kids.

00:30:00:01 - 00:30:17:03
James Somerton
And, you know, there's always been American animation that's done that Ralph Bakshi and stuff like that. But it's always kind of been like South Park adjacent where it's like it's not just for kids, but kids can't watch it now. It's kind of all ages means, yeah, your ten year old can watch it and you 40 year olds can watch it and enjoy it.

00:30:17:03 - 00:30:23:08
Nick Herrgott
So very mature for a kid show to like it. Oh, yeah. Access it Like it's like we say about Star Wars. It's kid accessible.

00:30:23:08 - 00:30:26:11
James Somerton
Yeah. Like there was a little bit of blood. Not much. There was a spurt that was it.

00:30:27:05 - 00:30:28:22
Nick Herrgott
Was a juice box.

00:30:30:07 - 00:30:50:11
James Somerton
No, no. When when she got hit, right? When she took the arrow to the knee, there was like he pulled it out a little and spurted and. Yeah. But there was like there was some violence. There was, you know, there was no cursing, no, there was no nothing sexual. Almost cursing almost at the very end. Yeah, there was nothing sexual.

00:30:50:11 - 00:30:55:12
James Somerton
The closest thing to sex was a leg, a quick peck between the two guys at the very end.

00:30:56:11 - 00:31:00:13
Nick Herrgott
And a lot of very strong sexual tension. Sexual tension?

00:31:00:13 - 00:31:01:19
Speaker 2
Continued tension.

00:31:01:19 - 00:31:02:03
James Somerton
Yes.

00:31:02:16 - 00:31:09:00
Nick Herrgott
Oh, I. Yeah, I understand why they brought them back together at the end, but I'm still like, I wouldn't know if I. If.

00:31:09:17 - 00:31:15:12
James Somerton
If I had my extra half hour, I would have had like the sort of Daniel Marshall where he's like.

00:31:15:13 - 00:31:17:02
Nick Herrgott
There's a lot of broken trust.

00:31:17:02 - 00:31:20:14
James Somerton
Hi. Can I come in? No, just like.

00:31:20:18 - 00:31:22:01
Nick Herrgott
We're not. We're not there.

00:31:22:01 - 00:31:31:04
James Somerton
Yet. Like, Yeah, like make him kind of earn his way back in. And, like, he was hot, though, so I get it. But at the same time, I'm like, he was.

00:31:31:04 - 00:31:49:00
Nick Herrgott
Hot, but privileged and like. Like very pretty. But that's the thing that this, this also didn't explore in a way that I wish I wish if it was longer than it could have, because they could have explored that wealth dichotomy. Because I've heard this. Yes, I brought this up before, but I've heard from multiple people, poor people being like, Yeah, I dated a rich guy once.

00:31:49:00 - 00:31:54:20
Nick Herrgott
He asked what my favorite cheese was. I didn't know what to answer. I said cheddar, and he looked egregiously offended.

00:31:55:21 - 00:31:59:13
James Somerton
I was going to say brioche. That's not cheese, that's bread. But like.

00:31:59:13 - 00:32:01:14
Nick Herrgott
Like that Brie.

00:32:01:14 - 00:32:02:03
James Somerton
Is cheese.

00:32:02:03 - 00:32:03:00
Nick Herrgott
Though. He is.

00:32:03:02 - 00:32:03:19
James Somerton
I don't like it.

00:32:05:08 - 00:32:12:15
Nick Herrgott
So, like. Like that kind of dichotomy. Like, I kind of I talked about this in the tragedy being rich. Yeah. The idea of like.

00:32:12:15 - 00:32:17:05
James Somerton
Which is the young Royals video Young Royals season three has just wrapped so watch tragedy of being right.

00:32:17:05 - 00:32:33:14
Nick Herrgott
There. There is like this compulsive incompatibility between rich and poor people that there needs to be a lot of work to get over. Yeah. In a way that rich people just do fundamentally do not understand how poor people function or how you can function any other way.

00:32:33:17 - 00:33:02:09
James Somerton
And there's also, you know, there is also from the poor perspective, I think for a lot of people, you know, for a lot of poor people, it's like I got I can have a rich boyfriend, fuck, yes. But a lot of people who have like dated someone who has money, huge inadequacy. Yeah. Like I've talked to people who they they think I'm, like, super rich because I have a semi-successful YouTube channel and they find out I have like, they see my YouTube channel and they see like, wow, 300,000 subscribers.

00:33:02:15 - 00:33:15:19
James Somerton
They immediately think I'm like, fucking Jenna marbles over here. Yeah, yeah. And it get they get quiet and it seems like there's a power imbalance and I'm like, I, it's, I probably make less money than you do.

00:33:16:01 - 00:33:17:13
Speaker 2
Yeah. Like so.

00:33:18:04 - 00:33:18:12
Nick Herrgott
Yeah.

00:33:18:12 - 00:33:20:03
James Somerton
And power imbalance isn't there.

00:33:20:13 - 00:33:20:16
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:33:21:02 - 00:33:29:15
Nick Herrgott
Um, so that wasn't in there and that was, it was hinted. But again, like another reason, like if you were going to explore the reason why they would separate.

00:33:29:18 - 00:33:44:04
James Somerton
I think they were kind of like we are. I feel like the thought process was probably like we've got gay nights and we've got a trans or gender queer allegory. Let's not muddle that down with economic issues. Yeah.

00:33:45:05 - 00:33:47:06
Nick Herrgott
Because it was kind of fun. Like with the mistrust of.

00:33:47:06 - 00:34:11:00
James Somerton
The past, it was trust touched on. But like, I think that's something they could do in a sequel because it's like, okay, you know, these characters are queer now you get it. You know, this character can switch genders and I can do anything that they want. So we can deal with something that like, okay, the basically the church is gone now, but there's still a very ingrained mistrust.

00:34:11:00 - 00:34:11:19
Nick Herrgott
Of the poor.

00:34:11:20 - 00:34:14:04
James Somerton
Yeah. And like that could be very good sequel.

00:34:14:04 - 00:34:14:15
Nick Herrgott
Fodder.

00:34:15:16 - 00:34:24:18
James Somerton
Because it's like, you know, what kind of monster grows out of, you know, that kind of. Yeah. Hatred toward the someone lesser than you. Yeah.

00:34:25:10 - 00:34:25:19
Nick Herrgott
One thing I.

00:34:25:19 - 00:34:28:19
James Somerton
Did, the allegorical monster being worse than the actual monster kind.

00:34:28:19 - 00:34:42:05
Nick Herrgott
Of thing. One thing I wish there was more because there was this one we touched on briefly was planting mistrust of everyone when it was kind of revealed that What's her name? Not Loretta. Loretta No. Shapeshifter girl.

00:34:42:17 - 00:34:43:05
James Somerton
Nimona.

00:34:43:06 - 00:34:43:19
Nick Herrgott
Nimona.

00:34:44:00 - 00:34:44:15
James Somerton
It's the movie.

00:34:45:02 - 00:34:57:19
Nick Herrgott
Name. I know. I completely blanked when it kind of found out that she can. She's a shape shifter. She started to be like, Oh, she could be anyone. And then, like, you know, you saw people being mistrustful of each other, backing.

00:34:57:19 - 00:34:58:12
James Somerton
Away from their friends.

00:34:58:13 - 00:35:04:21
Nick Herrgott
I would like I would have liked to see more of that. Maybe a specific reference to being mistrusting someone inside the public bathroom.

00:35:04:21 - 00:35:05:17
Speaker 2
Like, yeah.

00:35:06:16 - 00:35:09:02
Nick Herrgott
Kind of getting a little bit deeper into that.

00:35:09:02 - 00:35:12:15
James Somerton
I mean, I can understand why they wouldn't want to deal with the bathroom thing specifically.

00:35:12:18 - 00:35:16:16
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, but like having this kind of more specific interests, but like, oh, anyone could be trans.

00:35:16:22 - 00:35:21:01
James Somerton
And again, that's why I'm like, you know, an extra 20 to an extra 20 or 30 minutes into the movie. Yeah.

00:35:21:08 - 00:35:27:01
Nick Herrgott
But they were expensive at that point. They were actually running low on time. That was coming. That was at the beginning of the third act.

00:35:27:02 - 00:35:28:17
James Somerton
Yeah, I like that kind of so they.

00:35:28:17 - 00:35:30:13
Nick Herrgott
Had to get this ball rolling.

00:35:30:17 - 00:35:44:04
James Somerton
And keeping in mind as well, like length, like I'm like, Oh, they should have done another half hour. They were abandoned by Disney and left to fend for themselves with an independent production company. They so they probably didn't have a ton of money in animation as.

00:35:44:04 - 00:35:50:03
Nick Herrgott
Expected, like all of these gaps, I guess. And I'm willing to forgive it's for for this reason because it didn't really feel like the movie was missing anything.

00:35:50:05 - 00:35:53:18
James Somerton
No, it wasn't missing exactly. It didn't feel like it was missing anything.

00:35:54:01 - 00:36:00:18
Nick Herrgott
But I'm just pointing out things that they kind of put their toe into a little bit so they could have expanded if they wanted to.

00:36:00:18 - 00:36:18:04
James Somerton
Yeah. And I'm kind of looking at it as like, everybody go watch it. So we got a sequel. Yeah, right. So that the sequel can kind of expand upon this because I would like Riz Ahmed to have more work. He's a very talented actor and he doesn't get paid. He doesn't get working off because he's brown resume and he was in.

00:36:20:06 - 00:36:20:17
Speaker 2
Whole.

00:36:21:00 - 00:36:30:15
James Somerton
Shit. I forget the movie's name. He was in Rogue One. He was in I forget the name of the movie. I think he got an Oscar nomination for it. Oh, he's.

00:36:30:15 - 00:36:37:05
Nick Herrgott
Cute. Yeah, he wasn't Rogue one. I have heard, like, Oscar buzz for him. Oh, it seems like he got an Oscar.

00:36:37:23 - 00:36:45:19
James Somerton
Oh. Oh, he did win an Oscar. Yeah. Yeah, that was. I forget what that was for, I think. I think that was for the Jake Gyllenhaal movie.

00:36:46:10 - 00:36:49:19
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, Maybe. I mean, Academy Award winner resume ADD. Yeah.

00:36:50:23 - 00:36:56:23
James Somerton
And for. Oh, also for people who know who she is. Frances Conroy. Also, she voices a character in this.

00:36:57:10 - 00:37:03:10
Nick Herrgott
And the director, right. Um, the blond woman. Yes.

00:37:03:12 - 00:37:19:05
James Somerton
Yeah. And Frances Conroy was on Six Feet Under and she was also, you know, famous for being an American horror story. Balenciaga like playing Myrtle Snow and lots of other characters. But she's been, you know, very famous lately for American Horror Story. She's in there. Oh, that's.

00:37:19:05 - 00:37:21:10
Nick Herrgott
Her. I know when I know who Myrtle is.

00:37:21:16 - 00:37:22:00
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:37:22:20 - 00:37:34:15
James Somerton
So it's like it's a super queer, inclusive cast. And even the characters that aren't played or played by queer people are played by, like, dyed in the Wool allies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's just it's so refreshing.

00:37:34:19 - 00:37:35:23
Speaker 2
To see a movie.

00:37:36:06 - 00:37:53:16
James Somerton
Where there's, like, no caveats. There's no the animators were put through hell. There's no, the main actors are shit head. There's no the director sexually assaulted someone, right. There's none of it. It's just like I can just enjoy this. And not only can I just enjoy it, it's gay.

00:37:53:16 - 00:38:04:14
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, it's. I was, like, surprised. Like I said, first 5 minutes after the introduction, kind of like Prolog. Like, it's like, Oh, they're there. Oh, they're getting close. Oh, hands are touching. Oh, they're leaning.

00:38:04:20 - 00:38:05:21
James Somerton
Yeah. Guys like other lean.

00:38:06:04 - 00:38:08:18
Speaker 2
Oh, got his head is on his shoulder and.

00:38:09:09 - 00:38:17:13
James Somerton
I'm like, oh my God. They went there and then when they actually had the kiss at the end, I was like, oh they, they beat the urine ice curse. Yeah. Like they, they, they stepped.

00:38:17:13 - 00:38:18:17
Speaker 2
Over the line. They do this.

00:38:20:05 - 00:38:24:20
Nick Herrgott
I'm not going to lie like, especially because from being on some streams and people being like, your voice is.

00:38:24:20 - 00:38:26:16
James Somerton
So, oh I have no problem with your.

00:38:26:18 - 00:38:35:21
Nick Herrgott
On. And that's what I mean. Like I want more like urine I swear it's like abundantly apparent, but it's like, you know, never quote unquote confirmed and like yes I want to.

00:38:36:11 - 00:38:36:18
Speaker 2
Just.

00:38:37:10 - 00:38:52:03
James Somerton
I that's just like my but you're on ice is my like it's obvious but you know, they just stayed behind that one line and I know why because of censorship laws and all that sort of stuff. Not censorship laws. It's the advertising.

00:38:52:12 - 00:38:55:15
Nick Herrgott
Well, yeah, not even that. But like, I will push back against that being like.

00:38:55:16 - 00:39:00:02
James Somerton
No, it's fine. It's not about it's not about the relationship. It's about you're is kind of just that.

00:39:00:02 - 00:39:04:05
Nick Herrgott
But I think it's still qualifying to believe that even if there isn't any kissing because.

00:39:04:05 - 00:39:06:04
James Somerton
If anyone says you're on ice and gay as fuck, they're.

00:39:06:04 - 00:39:13:04
Nick Herrgott
Not. Yeah, because like guys like, you know, asexual people exist and sometimes they don't like kissing and that doesn't mean they don't like being romantic.

00:39:13:04 - 00:39:34:05
James Somerton
And I actually getting very off topic, but I actually really like the fact that there's a lot of people online who are like, you're on the spectrum. Like Yuri is like madly in love with Viktor, but like, you know, Viktor and and Kristoff Kristoff jump in bed with them. And his first thought is your, your, your feet are cold.

00:39:34:13 - 00:39:39:15
James Somerton
So it's like that is not, you know, horny, horny 20 year old. Yeah. Activity.

00:39:39:16 - 00:39:40:01
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:39:41:11 - 00:39:59:03
Nick Herrgott
I like and that's okay. Like you don't and that's what I like like you say about lots of things that doesn't indie dicks and that's for it to qualify as gay like yeah if we're trying to present queer experiences, then we need to. Brod I hate saying that because like, we need to broaden our definition of what qualifies as queer experience because then we get more of this allegorical bullshit.

00:39:59:10 - 00:40:10:14
James Somerton
With Nimona, we don't get the allegorical with, with trans and non-binary gender queer kind of stuff. We there is a bit of an allegory there, but with the gay stuff, it is right there.

00:40:10:14 - 00:40:14:23
Nick Herrgott
Yeah. Because I don't dislike allegory and I think that it's useful and I don't. I hate.

00:40:14:23 - 00:40:16:04
James Somerton
That you're not talking.

00:40:16:13 - 00:40:29:06
Nick Herrgott
Right. Like I like seeing allegory. But at the same time, I also don't think that I think that hiding behind allegory is bad. So, yes, we got Nimona, it's very trans and gender nonbinary, non-conforming, and.

00:40:29:06 - 00:40:32:03
James Somerton
Like Indya Moore, who is not gender.

00:40:32:03 - 00:40:32:16
Speaker 2
Queer.

00:40:32:18 - 00:40:34:03
Nick Herrgott
Or I think gender.

00:40:34:03 - 00:40:36:19
James Somerton
Or non-binary gender fluid.

00:40:36:19 - 00:40:39:23
Nick Herrgott
I think I think nonbinary non-binary is the umbrella definition.

00:40:40:08 - 00:40:40:17
James Somerton
Okay.

00:40:42:05 - 00:40:44:00
Nick Herrgott
I was hearing fireworks in the background.

00:40:44:01 - 00:40:45:03
James Somerton
Because it's Canada.

00:40:45:03 - 00:40:45:23
Speaker 2
Today.

00:40:46:09 - 00:40:48:02
James Somerton
Um, we haven't left the house.

00:40:48:09 - 00:40:50:06
Nick Herrgott
We haven't. It was raining for most of today.

00:40:50:07 - 00:41:05:11
James Somerton
Yeah. Nick slept over last night so that we could do movie stuff. We did. We have there's going to be a video coming out in a couple of days, kind of talking about some Tello stuff. So look forward to that. So it's going to come out for for patrons as well. It's not like a video essay or anything.

00:41:05:11 - 00:41:05:19
James Somerton
It's just some.

00:41:05:19 - 00:41:30:14
Nick Herrgott
Explanations. So we're talking about, yeah, like allegories. So like we got Nimona and it's great, but we shouldn't keep hiding behind this because one thing that happens with these allegorical representations and I've had to take some people close to me to task for this, is it gets into the cycle of No, it was about like monsters. It was about like, you know, it wasn't specifically oh sure, non-binary people can be included, but this movie was about weirdos in general and.

00:41:30:14 - 00:41:37:21
James Somerton
Even with like there was so much like, I can see how you could see this is a gay experience, but it's really just about Monster boys.

00:41:37:21 - 00:41:38:13
Nick Herrgott
It's like it's a.

00:41:38:17 - 00:41:40:02
James Somerton
Bunch of little queer.

00:41:40:21 - 00:41:41:21
Speaker 2
A little weird.

00:41:43:07 - 00:41:44:18
Nick Herrgott
They're trying to hide their colors.

00:41:45:04 - 00:41:46:06
Speaker 2
Like, ah, Dahmer.

00:41:49:00 - 00:41:58:04
James Somerton
But like right now with Nimona, like, I hope it takes off because it was, like, so much fun. But like, even on Rotten Tomatoes, it's got a 94% right.

00:41:58:04 - 00:41:59:20
Nick Herrgott
Now for animations. That's weird.

00:42:00:02 - 00:42:01:12
Speaker 2
And it's even.

00:42:01:19 - 00:42:04:01
James Somerton
It's 94% among critics and.

00:42:04:01 - 00:42:05:14
Speaker 2
Audiences. That never.

00:42:05:14 - 00:42:06:00
Nick Herrgott
Happens.

00:42:06:16 - 00:42:31:08
James Somerton
Like it is such a fun and just like especially with all the stuff that's going on, all the crap that's going on for queer people all over the goddamn globe. Yeah, that there is this animated movie on Netflix that you can watch and just enjoy is like, and I want to give a shout out to the show Glamorous, which is also also just came out on Netflix, which is another extremely queer thing on Netflix.

00:42:31:09 - 00:42:32:13
Nick Herrgott
Making up for Dave Chappelle.

00:42:33:10 - 00:42:45:16
James Somerton
Right that you can just watch and enjoy. And like most of the cast of Glamorous are people of color. Like it's like Kim. I think I think Kim Cattrall is like the only like white person in the cast.

00:42:45:16 - 00:42:47:12
Nick Herrgott
And, you know, we we kind of stand her.

00:42:47:21 - 00:43:07:02
James Somerton
Oh, yeah. Like she can she can do whatever she wants and like, yeah, Netflix is kind of making up for lost time, but it's like advertising is things like glamorous. They get quite a bit of advertising. It looks like there's probably going to be a season two. It's done quite well, but like I haven't seen maybe it's maybe, you know, in like animation circles and stuff.

00:43:07:02 - 00:43:10:04
James Somerton
Nimona is like very well known, but like took.

00:43:10:04 - 00:43:13:12
Nick Herrgott
The first Spider-Verse movie a little bit to kind of get word of mouth out there.

00:43:13:17 - 00:43:30:00
James Somerton
Yeah. And like, I wouldn't expect like, oh, in a month or two in a month, they're going to announce a sequel. Like with movies, you can take more time than with TV shows because scheduling for a movie is much different, especially for animation, because you can be like, Oh, resume AD can only come in on this week and Chloe Grace Moretz can only come in and this week it doesn't matter.

00:43:30:00 - 00:43:34:21
James Somerton
They're they're not acting together, they're in a booth, you know, it's just animators.

00:43:34:21 - 00:43:35:03
Nick Herrgott
And yeah.

00:43:35:03 - 00:43:53:05
James Somerton
Yeah. So far nothing has come out saying that the animators were like, tortured, tortured and, you know, put on the rack and stuff. So, you know, that's nice because everything else, apparently the animators are just treated like shit. Yeah, it's like, Oh my God, the animators need a union.

00:43:53:18 - 00:43:55:03
Nick Herrgott
So many things and the union.

00:43:55:22 - 00:44:02:13
James Somerton
YouTubers need a union. But yeah, it is. It was surprisingly good. I was very.

00:44:02:20 - 00:44:10:03
Nick Herrgott
Very I went in with high expectations because of the Rotten Tomatoes score, I'll be honest like, and you know, my expectations were met.

00:44:10:06 - 00:44:35:01
James Somerton
I kind of went in thinking like, okay, it's a kid's movie and expecting a good kid's movie. So I was a little shocked at how it it didn't like break out of the mold. It's not like it's not a kid's movie. Yeah, but it's stretched. It's yeah, it's like it is still perfectly fine for kids to watch and really good for them.

00:44:35:10 - 00:44:36:15
James Somerton
There's really good message. And it took.

00:44:36:15 - 00:44:42:14
Nick Herrgott
A run up to the Shrek franchise and spin offs as far as violence went, it was a little bit more violent. Graphically, it was.

00:44:42:20 - 00:44:44:15
James Somerton
Closer to Puss in Boots.

00:44:44:15 - 00:44:45:02
Nick Herrgott
Yes.

00:44:45:02 - 00:44:45:18
James Somerton
Than Shrek.

00:44:45:18 - 00:44:54:18
Nick Herrgott
I think it really went even. It was either the good puss targeting Puss in Boots, because Puss in Boots didn't show much violence against like, people. Yeah. Villains.

00:44:54:20 - 00:44:55:05
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:44:55:18 - 00:44:58:22
Nick Herrgott
But this was very much like, you know, like we're bastions and skulls.

00:44:59:01 - 00:44:59:10
James Somerton
Yeah.

00:44:59:11 - 00:45:00:09
Nick Herrgott
Violence.

00:45:00:15 - 00:45:09:12
James Somerton
Like stabbing people. Yeah. And stuff like that Caused quite a bit of people got run through with swords, actually. Yeah, But, you know, just the one spurted blood.

00:45:09:20 - 00:45:10:01
Speaker 2
Yeah.

00:45:10:16 - 00:45:12:07
James Somerton
But yeah, like if you had it was.

00:45:12:07 - 00:45:14:06
Nick Herrgott
Off screen and it wasn't from a wound.

00:45:14:17 - 00:45:16:23
James Somerton
Well it was from a wound you just didn't see coming out of that.

00:45:16:23 - 00:45:20:11
Nick Herrgott
That's what I mean. Like that the, the visuals didn't show it coming from a movie.

00:45:20:11 - 00:45:28:00
James Somerton
And another thing I've got to say is the visuals for Pneumonias Face had me in stitches multiple times throughout the movie.

00:45:28:00 - 00:45:30:12
Nick Herrgott
So much good visual comedy for that.

00:45:30:12 - 00:45:33:03
James Somerton
Yeah. And Chloe Grace Moretz again, did a fantastic job.

00:45:33:05 - 00:45:35:11
Nick Herrgott
Everyone did needs to get more work.

00:45:35:13 - 00:45:54:15
James Somerton
She does. She keeps doing movies that aren't successful and people blame it on her. And she's like, I'm like, it's not her fault that the Carrie remake didn't do well. But yeah, you should definitely check it out. Like if you like animation, if you like gay stuff, queer stuff, you should definitely check it out. It is absolutely worth watching.

00:45:54:22 - 00:46:09:03
James Somerton
I Think it was a great movie to start this new podcast Podcast's podcast off with. This'll be the podcast will be coming out on July 5th because there's no point in releasing it before on July 4th weekend. Y'all are.

00:46:09:03 - 00:46:09:15
Speaker 2
Busy.

00:46:10:23 - 00:46:23:04
James Somerton
So this will be coming out July 5th. We're recording it on the first, so there'll be another one next week and we're going to keep doing this because we got a lot of movies to get through and I think this is a great way to start it off.

00:46:23:04 - 00:46:25:05
Nick Herrgott
It was fun. I liked this one and.

00:46:25:05 - 00:46:27:03
James Somerton
We got to avoid watching Hamilton.

00:46:27:04 - 00:46:29:05
Nick Herrgott
We got to avoid watching him.

00:46:29:06 - 00:46:32:03
James Somerton
We were going to watch and compare the producers and Hamilton the.

00:46:32:03 - 00:46:35:16
Nick Herrgott
Producers movie, the 2005 or five remake.

00:46:35:21 - 00:46:40:03
James Somerton
And and I just started this last night. That was a good idea.

00:46:40:04 - 00:46:51:09
Nick Herrgott
We've been dreading it. We did not want to watch Hamilton. I want to I don't want to watch. I really don't want to watch Hamilton.

00:46:51:09 - 00:46:54:06
James Somerton
It's like when people ask me about the supernatural video. I'm like.

00:46:54:11 - 00:46:55:12
Speaker 2
Especially with.

00:46:55:17 - 00:47:00:00
Nick Herrgott
The the weird reason I don't want to watch Hannibal, and this is weird Hamilton, but I say.

00:47:00:01 - 00:47:00:14
James Somerton
Hannibal.

00:47:00:14 - 00:47:01:15
Nick Herrgott
Hannibal, I do want to watch.

00:47:01:15 - 00:47:02:16
James Somerton
Hannibal. You watched Hannibal.

00:47:03:10 - 00:47:03:20
Nick Herrgott
Where is.

00:47:03:20 - 00:47:04:11
James Somerton
Season four?

00:47:04:11 - 00:47:06:10
Nick Herrgott
Where it's season four? They could just do a movie.

00:47:07:09 - 00:47:14:14
James Somerton
Oh, we've talked about we won't get into the details we've talked about on stream and stuff, but trans Clarice. Trans Clarice. That's how you do The Silence of the Lambs story.

00:47:15:05 - 00:47:22:05
Nick Herrgott
Um, so like, I didn't want to watch Hamilton because, like, out of all of the royals in the world.

00:47:22:19 - 00:47:26:18
Speaker 2
What But correct, you out.

00:47:26:18 - 00:47:43:15
Nick Herrgott
Of all the royals in the world, I actually have the most respect for King George. I don't remember it. I think it's King George the fifth. Something that specific King George, because I'm like, he struggled a lot with mental health. Yeah. And probably neurodivergent. And he stayed alive in spite of it, which.

00:47:43:15 - 00:47:46:14
James Somerton
Is being dealt with on the Netflix show. Queen Charlotte.

00:47:46:15 - 00:47:49:01
Nick Herrgott
Which I've heard is actually really, really good. My mom, like my.

00:47:49:01 - 00:47:51:23
James Somerton
Mom brilliant, has been telling me to watch it, but I need to get through glamorous.

00:47:51:23 - 00:47:56:12
Nick Herrgott
First. My mom liked Queen Charlotte, the mini series way better than George Bridgerton. She said she.

00:47:56:15 - 00:47:59:15
James Somerton
Has no interest in Bridgerton, but I am interested in Queen Charlotte.

00:47:59:18 - 00:48:07:00
Nick Herrgott
Tonight. I watched in for a bit of Queen Charlotte and I was like, I know it's going. I like, I like what's going on there. So yeah, quick. King George, I'm a big.

00:48:07:00 - 00:48:15:15
James Somerton
Fan actor who plays King George in Queen Charlotte is also openly gay and he's playing a straight lead. Yeah, and I'm a romantic straight lead. And I'm like, Oh, boy, God, Go.

00:48:15:16 - 00:48:34:20
Nick Herrgott
Yeah, go off. So like, yeah. King George dealt with a lot of mental health problems when he got to a point in his career where he couldn't continue doing public appearances, he went and actually managed the kingdom. Yeah. And fought for a lot of, you know, humanitarian rights and stuff and the rhetoric. And he was toasted well into the American Revolution by the.

00:48:34:20 - 00:48:36:15
James Somerton
By the by the by the founding.

00:48:36:20 - 00:49:00:02
Nick Herrgott
Fathers. Their beef was with English parliament, not the crown. Yeah, but when they started realizing we're not going to win this, they turned to a propaganda smear campaign and turned him into the mad King. Yeah. So he was not the villain of this story. And like, Hamilton kind of just represents to me this, kind of archetypical American fix for propaganda is let's replace the existing propaganda with other different propaganda.

00:49:00:02 - 00:49:00:23
Nick Herrgott
That's also not true.

00:49:00:23 - 00:49:13:02
James Somerton
Yeah, let's literally anyway change the Constitution. No, we'll not change the costumes, but yeah. So yeah. Thank you guys so much for listening. I hope you enjoyed it. Please leave comments in the wherever you want to leave.

00:49:13:06 - 00:49:16:13
Nick Herrgott
Where they get read for Phil, for for having, you know, an inkling of support for King George.

00:49:16:14 - 00:49:17:03
Speaker 2
Oh, probably.

00:49:19:04 - 00:49:31:12
James Somerton

00:49:31:12 - 00:49:34:01
Nick Herrgott
We have a format, too, because it was so hard to come up with podcast.

00:49:34:02 - 00:49:35:10
James Somerton
Oh, God, it was so. And I.

00:49:35:10 - 00:49:37:10

00:49:57:00 - 00:50:19:18
Speaker 1
Sensitive on. Peeling back my skin to tell me. But so of this by myself, Phil just got me.

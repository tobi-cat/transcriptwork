Hello, everyone. My name is James, and today I'm going to explain to you how Marvel Comics accidentally created a gay power couple and, despite their best efforts to avoid it, how Disney might be giving us our first big-screen gay superheroes. Going from the Holocaust to superheroes. Nothing like tonal whiplash! Well, that's not entirely true. There's a sort of connection, since we will be talking about the Scarlet Witch, who is sometimes a mutant and occasionally the daughter of Magneto, who is usually a survivor of the Holocaust. Let's get started.

[Dan Olson, in response to "why is this video so ugly?"](https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman/status/1789146632371810446): "The original video was over-exposed, but the peak brightness has been brought down aggressively which creates a very unnatural contrast between highlights and shadow. Combined with the muddy off-green tint in the highlights, the result is skin tones like stale pea soup. Add to it the very hard key edge and the lack of cohesion between foreground and background, the end result is fake, cheap, and gross, like an FVM from a Red Alert knockoff made by children. The green shift in the highlights has a greater impact on white than it does on patches of skin that are more red/blue dominant, like lips and the bags under his eyes, which shift less and thus stand out more, adding to the overall corpse-in-early-putrefaction appearance."

I wasn't always a fan of comic books. Outside of a Batman trade paperback here and there — you know, self-contained stories — I wasn't ever really interested in the ongoing, developing stories of comics that have stretched from now all the way back to the 1930s. But all you really need to become a lifelong fan is one character, and because these universes are interactive, that one character can expose you to other characters, who can then expose you to larger stories, and then before you know it, you know more about Marvel or DC characters than your own family. I mean, there are worse habits, all things considered: meth keepsakes or dental problems.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Marvel Comics over the years doesn't have the best track record when it comes to gay characters, though. Well, most comic book companies don't really. Northstar barely gets any attention at all, Loki's queerness is swept under the rug at every opportunity they get, and <mark fc=false>Iceman's recent gay revelation was more of a “screw you” from Brian Michael Bendis to Isaac Perlmutter than a well-thought-out storyline. Though what a wonderful “up yours” to Perlmutter it was!</mark> If you don't know who Isaac Perlmutter is, don't worry, I'll get to him. So, you'd probably be kind of shocked to find out that in current Marvel Comics, the most powerful magical person in the Marvel universe is a gay character, and his boyfriend is literally the King of Space. And those two characters, Billy Kaplan and Teddy Altman [images of characters appear next to James], better known as Wiccan and Hulkling, are the most shipped couple in all of Marvel fandom. And they are the children of some very powerful and very weird Marvel characters.

## The Kids are Not Alright

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

There aren't many Marvel kids, as in, characters who were born to existing characters in the Marvel universe. Which is weird because comics are soap operas, and that shit usually gets eaten up. But children in comics create a bit of a weird problem, namely, the timeline. Most things in comics, and Marvel uses this especially, are left ambiguous as to when, exactly, they happen. It makes sense for Thor to look the same after 40 years, but Iron Man's only aged maybe 5 or 10 years since the 1960s. Marvel Comics loves to use a sliding scale of time. For instance, references to Tony Stark's capture and creation of the Mark 1 Iron Man suit change depending upon when the particular story was told. This could be the Korean War, Vietnam, or conflicts in the Middle East.

<u>[Cut to Nick sitting at a desk. Caption: “Nick Herrgott: Thinks he knows stuff.”]</u> Which you'd think they'd use that as a theme about the omnipresence of the American war machine and the role that technological innovations and weapons profiteering plays into that. You know, like Stan Lee intended. That was before Marvel corporate decided that having a conflicted heroic character was a bit too spicy.

</nick>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Okay. Thank you, Nick. Anyway, children of existing characters rock this flexible time scale because they put hard dates on parents’ ages. The parents’ minimum age must become the age that they were when the child was born, plus however old the child becomes. So, what does that mean for Billy and Teddy, whose prominent Marvel parents are the Scarlet Witch, the Vision, and Mar-Vell, a.k.a., the first Captain Marvel? And especially, how do these very strange parents factor into how the characters are built?

For Teddy, this is easy. Imagine Romeo and Juliet set in space, only Juliet is a shape- shifting green alien. The doomed relationship was tied to a much larger event in Marvel, the Kree–Skrull war. We've already seen both of these species in the movies, featured prominently in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain Marvel*, but in the comics, the script is flipped. The Skrulls were the evil, devious bad guys and not an analogy for refugees like they are in the MCU. And also, the Kree–Skrull war started specifically because Mar-Vell impregnated Princess Anelle of the Skrull Empire. It should be noted that Mar-Vell was never really that popular, though Marvel tried to push his significance to the credit of a small cult following. The real reason he was kept in publication was because DC had their own Captain Marvel, and Marvel Comics didn't want to let them have the copyright to the name. DC's Captain Marvel would eventually become Shazam, but as soon as DC threw in the towel on their Captain Marvel, Marvel Comics seemed to give up on keeping Mar-Vell regularly published, which is why he more or less vanished from publication history, culminating in his canonical death in 1982.

This phrasing implies that the Kree are the good guys in the comics, but they’re not (see [How the Kree-Skrull War Paved the Road to ‘Empyre’ | Marvel](https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/how-the-kree-skrull-war-paved-the-road-to-empyre)). The Kree killed the other race inhabiting their planet and the Skrulls who gave that race technology. The Kree then used that technology to begin their own interstellar empire.

His real contribution to Marvel was his legacy, both in the way the title of Captain Marvel was shuffled around to a number of different major characters and in Carol Danvers, who began as a “girl power” spin-off to Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and ended up eclipsing the original's popularity, eventually becoming the current, reigning Captain Marvel. And of course, he left behind that dangling thread about what happened to his wife and child when they ran away together at the end of the crossover event. Because the Princess was never seen again. By the time the Young Avengers come around, Teddy Altman is introduced as a mutant with shape-shifting abilities. Not out of the ordinary for mutant powers, really, But there's a twist. It turns out that the Skrull princess actually sent her Kree–Skrull hybrid son, then Dorak VIII, renamed as Teddy, with his Skrull nanny to hide him away from her father. She remained with the autocracy and eventually perished. Furthermore, as Mar-Vell himself was a significant figure in the Kree society and the princess was the sole heir to the Skrull Empire, that places Teddy precariously in a singular spot of importance in two of the most significant galactic societies in Marvel. And if it's starting to seem like there'd be literally nobody in his dating league, just wait.

Let me finish. The Scarlet Witch may be a mutant, and her parentage has been in question for most of her publication. For a large part, it was believed that Magneto was her father, though this would change depending on the writer, or the decade, and whether or not Disney and Fox were in a spat.

So, as I was saying before being rudely interrupted by the “pants, please,” it's not entirely clear if she is or isn't a mutant, as per details in her most recent solo title. Regardless of her status as a mutant, her mutant powers, called hex magic, are secondary to her status as both a nexus being and a genetically altered conduit to the primordial god Chthon, which grants her access to his reality-rewriting chaos magic, which itself is ambiguous. And it is because of this magic, as well as her own study of witchcraft, and not necessarily her potential mutant powers, that she was able to conceive her children and then cast them through time and space to be raised, uh, separately by two completely unaware families.

<james {% include timecode %}>

<u>[Rumbling. White circles flash, and James replaces Nick in front of the amber backdrop.]</u> Oh, thank God. All right. So, very few characters in Marvel have had as many changes and tweaks made to their powers as the Scarlet Witch. Originally, yes, she started out as a mutant, but she was rescued by Magneto, who recruited her and her twin brother, Quicksilver, into the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. At this time, her powers were, as Nick said, hex magic. After abandoning the Brotherhood, she joined the Avengers with Quicksilver. Her powers were basically the most Silver Age thing ever. Essentially, the Avengers would get caught in a sticky situation with a bad guy and would then depend on her hexes as a last-minute ex-machina moment in every issue. Because comics. Unlike other characters, villains and heroes, in which meticulous care was given to explaining how their powers worked, Wanda's abilities were left as vague as possible, even, sometimes, to the extent of becoming a liability to the team. Over time, however, it seems that Wanda and Quicksilver's abilities were inconsistent and sometimes failed altogether.

Deciding to return to their home, the fictional nation of Transia, with the key landmark of Wundagore Mountain, the Maximoff twins learned that they were not, as they thought, born to Romani parents, but rather, adopted. They were born in a genetic facility inside Wundagore Mountain. Both of them were taken from birth and genetically redeveloped by the High Evolutionary.

Maybe in another video. Anyway, due to genetic re-encoding by the High Evolutionary, Wanda was accidentally made into the living conduit and avatar of the primordial god Chthon, who functions as sometimes, a god of chaos, other times, just a god of the underworld. But he's usually overshadowed by other demonic figures, such as Mephisto, who features later. This was the first time that it was really indicated that the Scarlet Witch was more powerful than it originally seemed. This was pivotal when Chthon possessed Wanda to try and return to the world so that he could unmake it. This plan was thwarted, but it was very clear that Wanda was a potential threat, so the Avengers began looking into options of how to safeguard her.

Eventually, in a crossover with the Fantastic Four, Wanda encounters Agatha Harkness, who is kind of America's number one witch. Agatha believes she has a solution for Wanda's unpredictability where she uses witchcraft as a conduit to, first of all, help Wanda focus her powers and have more control over them. Secondly, witchcraft gives Wanda a connection to the natural world where she can prepare hexes in advance and have much more control over the outcome. Though she was a natural in witchcraft, Wanda's priorities were always the Avengers, and she never devoted much time to the study of witchcraft with Agatha. Agatha, however, served as a guide to assist her with her abilities whenever she could.

I'm sorry. Okay, [an] ongoing problem for the Avengers was Kang the Conqueror, a time traveler. But there's a version of Kang where he goes so far into the future that he becomes Immortus, who is kind of a morally ambiguous micromanager of time. Sometimes friend, sometimes foe; depends on the version of Immortus, because there are many.

And after much will-they-won't-they, the Scarlet Witch gets married to the Vision.

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Because comics. But it's not like all of this happened over two issues. These are stories that have been crafted over two decades of weekly titles. Granted, this was when comic books actually took their time to pay off plot lines instead of trying to cram everything together into eight-issue runs that just changed the status quo every month. By the time the Vision and the Scarlet Witch get married on the urging of Immortus, all of the pieces have been adequately set in place for years before this. So, Wanda and the Vision get married, and things are going okay. But then there's this big pocket of magical energy that some evil witches want to use to make a[n] evil spell. Gonna do bad stuff.

</james>
<from></from>

<nick {% include timecode %}>

And Agatha is like, “Hey, Wanda, this is a— this is a bad idea. I need you to channel the energy, so they don't get it.” And Wanda's like, “What's the worst that could happen?”

<compare>

So, this power makes Wanda so, well, powerful that she's able to actually rewrite the very fabric of reality. And because Wanda's newly wed to a man with no genitals, she uses it to make herself pregnant.

But Wanda doesn't just want to be a homemaker like Sue Storm. She wants it all. She's going to be a part-time Avenger and a full-time mom. So, when the West Coast Avengers need a reserve member to help out, Wanda and Vision tag along. But the thing is, weird things start happening with Wanda's twins, Billy and Tommy. The sitter sometimes just can't find them, for instance. Meanwhile, after the Vision tried to take over all the computers in the world to become the human version of the Kree's Supreme Intelligence, a couple of world governments decide that he's a bit of a threat, capture him, and completely disassemble him. Which, you know, Wanda's not that pleased with. The Avengers then gaslight her into thinking that she has nothing to be upset about because the Vision was a robot anyway. You can't fall in love with a robot!

Right. So, with the Vision rebuilt as little more than a catatonic zombie, Wanda comes under a vast amount of duress because he then agrees with the Avengers, telling Wanda that her feelings for him are irrelevant. And then he dumps her. Wanda now has nothing but her beloved children, who, it is revealed, vanish when Wanda isn't thinking about them. That's why the babysitters were so stressed out. Cue Agatha Harkness.

So, Agatha’s like, “Okay, girl, sorry, but your kids don't exist. Turns out that the energy you absorbed was two fragments of Mephisto's soul, who—"

O-okay, there are a few Satan analogies in Marvel, and they all hate each other, but yes, Mephisto is the big one. He was fighting Franklin Richards, son of Reed Richards, from the Fantastic Four, and Franklin's, like, super powerful, and he managed to split Mephisto's soul into six fragments, with Mephisto himself only possessing one-sixth of his power.

And all the while, Wanda and the West Coast Avengers have been fighting a villain named Master Pandemonium, a man who, after a car crash, made a deal with Mephisto to do his bidding as long as he could survive. Mephisto decides he's going to replace this guy's arms and legs with demons and that in order to keep his abilities, Master Pandemonium has to reclaim the five fragments of his soul, which have been [air quotes] “lost in the car crash.” You see, Mephisto, the King of Lies, was deceiving Master Pandemonium into finding his own soul fragments because he didn't want all of Hell to know that he'd lost so much of his power. Two of these soul fragments were the children of the Scarlet Witch.

Which is how we get BABY ARMS! [Image of a comic panel in which Master Pandemonium has two red-headed infants from the waist upwards in place of his hands.]

<james {% include timecode %}>

Right. Master Pandemonium, while the Scarlet Witch was distracted, snuck into her house and absorbed her babies into him. Which Mephisto then proceeded to absorb back into himself to regain his full power, which Master Pandemonium was not happy about, but them’s the breaks. So, then, Billy and Tommy’s souls somehow managed to be distributed back into the world as two children in the greater Manhattan area. Well, kind of. First, what happened is Agatha erased all of Wanda's memories of her children, which kind of worked, but she still ended up going into a grief spiral. Cue the rest of the Avengers, who were like, “Why is this happening?” And because they all collectively get the World's Worst Friend Award, they basically just ignore her grief. Ignore her in general, which allowed Magneto to step in and offer her fatherly support in this trying time. But instead, he uses her to help him create a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, because of course he does.

<james {% include timecode %}>

But this doesn't even matter! Because the whole thing was a ploy by Immortus so that he could use her to safeguard the Earth-616 timeline, the normal Marvel Comics timeline, from converging with other timelines and alternate realities. He planned to put Wanda into an eternal hypnotic trance so that he could use her as a nexus being and, by proxy of her, he could choose which timeline was true and filter out which ones were false. The whole ordeal with the Vision, Wanda's children, the Vision's dismemberment, her ensuing mental duress, and now Magneto's ploy was all puppeteered by Immortus so he could have Wanda in this state of emotional fragility. It was during this time, while under the control of Immortus by proxy of Magneto, that she briefly created a reality where she still had her children, demonstrating that she didn't even really need Mephisto's power to do this. It's believed that it was at this point that the twin souls were sent out to two separate expecting mothers, meaning that they are the children of the Scarlet Witch and not actually shards of Mephisto. Now.

And all of this took place from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Eventually, in the 2005 mini-series *Avengers Disassembled*, Wanda got her memories back, was none too pleased that the Avengers took them from her, and blamed them for the loss of her children. In her rage, she killed multiple Avengers before falling into a catatonic state and being whisked away by Magneto for safe keeping. Before this breakdown, though, she'd actually met a bullied young teenager named Billy, who idolized her. What Wanda hadn't realized was that this boy was the reincarnated soul of one of her lost sons, who, once the Avengers disbanded after the events of Disassembled, went on to help create a new team of Young Avengers.

## The Wizard and the Warrior

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We meet Billy and Teddy as we know them today in *Young Avengers* issue number one, released in April of 2005, immediately after Wanda's major breakdown. The pair have joined the Young Avengers in hopes of picking up the slack left behind after the Avengers proper disbanded. The team is originally comprised of Wiccan, Hulkling, Kate Bishop, Patriot, and Iron Lad. Later on in this run, the team would also be joined by Cassie Lang, Ant-Man's daughter; a young version of the Vision; and Tommy, Wanda's other son. Their first story sees them facing Kang the Conqueror. With advanced knowledge from the time-traveling Iron Lad, who is actually a young version of Kang, who is a younger version of Immortus. I never said this got simpler. The biggest news-getter of this initial run was, of course, the introduction of Billy and Teddy. We didn't know that they were the ultimate power couple just yet, but they were a teenage gay couple smack dab in the middle of a Marvel comic, so they got a lot of attention.

</james>
<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<mark fc=false>That almost wasn't the case, though. When Allan Heinberg, the creator of the team, initially pitched the idea to Marvel execs, they weren't too fond of the idea of having a gay couple in an Avengers title. In fact, word came down from Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive CEO of Marvel, known for being an arch-conservative racist homophobe, that there should absolutely not be a gay couple in an Avengers title.</mark> They did like the idea of a young Hulk and Thor, though. Billy's original superhero title was the Asgardian. So, the compromise was that Teddy, Hulkling, being a shapeshifter, would actually be a girl who shifts into the big, tough Hulkling when it's time to fight. <mark fc=false>This is the only reason that Wiccan and Hulkling actually made it into publication.</mark> But there was a wrinkle. See, Allan Heinberg was a well-known gay writer who had written for *Sex in the City*, so when word got out that he'd be writing the new Avengers series, <mark fc=false>the gay press interviewed him as much as possible. And he made sure to tell them that he would be writing a gay couple.</mark>

<mark fc=false>So, now the media was flush with stories about how Marvel would be featuring gay Avengers and how awesome and progressive Marvel was. They practically got handed a GLAAD Award before a single page was printed. So, now Marvel editorial was in a pickle: keep going with the agreed-upon shape-shifter angle, or revert to the original idea and have gay characters? One decision would massively piss off their CEO, but the other would massively piss off a segment of the population that was currently making *Queer as Folk* the most expensive show on TV to buy ads for. Gays have a lot of buying power, you see, with the whole no-children thing.</mark> So, they decided that Teddy would remain a boy. Oops.

<mark fc=false>But then word came down from Perlmutter to stop the run at six issues. He would not have gays queering up his comics.</mark> Bit of an overreaction, considering Billy and Teddy were only a small part of a large ensemble team. The thing is, though, money trumps hate almost every time. And when the pre-sale numbers came in for the *Young Avengers*, <mark fc=false>the run was extended to 12.</mark> And this time with leverage, Allan Heinberg decided that he'd make these six issues all about Billy and Teddy's relationship. The Super Skrull arrives and kills Teddy's mom after revealing to Teddy that she wasn't, in fact, his birth mother. Refer back to the Kree–Skrull war shenanigans.

This one wasn't easy to check, 'cause a lot of the comic book sites from 2005 don't exist anymore. But I did find a couple interviews with Heinberg preserved on LiveJournal and, assuming they're real, they completely contradict what Somerton says. [Heinberg says specifically that Marvel didn't do any pre-release hype for his gay couple because he asked them not to](http://youngavengers.livejournal.com/26314.html) because Billy and Teddy are just two characters in the ensemble, they're not what the comic's about, it's a new millennium let's not make a thing of it. 

He also says that his editors did not try and stop him - they actually pushed him to *make it gayer*. It is true that Teddy was gonna be a girl, [but the idea was that later, through alien magic or whatever, it would turn out she was actually a guy,](https://comicviews.livejournal.com/12843.html) and the whole reason for that is Heinberg was scared to come right out of the gate with a gay couple and that's how he was going to sneak them in there. But his editors told him "that sounds pretty complicated, why not just make them gay to begin with and be done with it." 

So there you go, assuming those interviews are real, that entire narrative is just completely out of his ass. And finally, according to Wikipedia, the series was always originally conceived as twelve issues instead of being bumped up from six. The citation is a dead link, but I found the writer of the article it was sourced from and he confirmed it, so even that little detail is false.

Also, Carol Danvers/Ms. Marvel/Captain Marvel wasn't introduced with the Fantastic Four - she was introduced in *Marvel Super-Heroes* #13 in 1968, then appeared in the *Captain Marvel* comics, then got her own series *Ms. Marvel* in 1977. The only significant interaction with the Fantastic Four that I could find was in the *Ultimate Fantastic Four*, an alternate universe series published in the mid 2000s. 

And Fox never had the rights to her. She was one of the few well-known female superheros that Marvel had the film rights to use before Disney purchased 20th Century Fox. [A quote from this 2018 Polygon article by Susana Polo](https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/19/17860712/captain-marvel-movie-powers-origin-carol-danvers-brie-larson-kelly-sue-deconnick): "Fans have been asking Marvel to greenlight a movie with a female lead for years. But the film rights to most of Marvel Comics’ most famous superheroines — Rogue, Storm, Jean Grey, Sue Storm and others — are held by 20th Century Fox. With a Black Widow movie backburnered until very recently, Carol Danvers’ Captain Marvel is not just the most powerful superheroine Marvel Studios could have chosen, but the most notable one, despite the fact that most folks outside of the comics world couldn’t be expected to know who she is." Marvel could've made a film about her whenever they wanted.

Anyway, the Super Skrull kills Teddy's mom but then feels bad about it after the Kree armada show up on Earth to kidnap Teddy and take him back to the Kree empire, where he will be the Prince of Space. The Skrulls also want him, though, and a mini episode of *Game of Thrones* plays out until the Super Skrull agrees to shapeshift into Teddy and submit himself to the invading forces so that Teddy can stay on Earth with Billy and his friends. After this run completed, again, with fantastic sales, Marvel editorial wanted Heinberg back to do more, but he was a bit busy producing episodes of *Grey's Anatomy* and writing *Wonder Woman* for DC. He'd eventually go on to write the good Wonder Woman movie. So, there was a long period in which Marvel would insert the Young Avengers, especially Billy and Teddy, into other titles in order to draw attention and sales. *Secret Invasion*, *Civil War*, *Dark Reign*, *Siege*: if there was a Marvel event worth reading, our boys made it into the pages somewhere.

Finally, in 2010, Heinberg agreed to come back to Marvel to write *The Children's Crusade*, a direct sequel to his *Young Avengers* run that would also bring back the Scarlet Witch after five years of not being in publication. In this series, Magneto learns that the Young Avengers are going to search for Wanda, who had vanished after the events of *House of M*, when she completely rewrote reality to give everyone their best life and eventually eliminated the vast majority of mutants from the Marvel universe. Magneto also learns that Wiccan and Speed are reincarnations of Wanda's children. He tracks them down and informs them that he is their grandfather and that he's going to help them find Wanda because he wants to try and be a good dad now. They do eventually find her, or so they think, but the Avengers attempt to apprehend her before Wiccan teleports Magneto, Wanda, and the Young Avengers to Wundagore Mountain. They soon realize, though, that the Scarlet Witch is actually a Doombot (robots made by Doctor Doom, in case that wasn’t obvious), prompting the Young Avengers and Magneto to journey to Latveria, with the Avengers following close behind.

He finally manages this, a battle ensues, he's defeated, and it's revealed that he was controlling Wanda when she committed the horrible acts of *Avengers Disassembled*, because if Wanda is doing something bad, she is absolutely being controlled by someone else.

I wasn't gonna this one... I looked and looked for Stan Lee saying anything about this particular comic, and I didn't find anything, but that doesn't mean he didn't say it. And it's not like Stan Lee wouldn't have said it - Stan Lee said that shit about everything, he was not shy about praising Marvel products. I didn't see him praising any of the modern comics, but like I said, a lot of those comic book sites from ten, fifteen years ago are gone now, so if it is a real quote, there's not really a way to track it down. So I was just gonna let this claim go. 

But then I took a second look and was like, "wait, what did he say there at the end?" Yeah, alright. Stan Lee *hated* the death of Gwen Stacy, **hated** it. <u>[Clip: "What about when when Marvel decided to kill Gwen Stacy? I heard that- "Ohhh... While I was in Europe, he killed Gwen Stacy! I didn't wanna kill her!"]</u> That's what he claimed at least, and that might have just been him responding to the fan backlash, but he certainly never claimed to like it. He was *very* consistent about this. That doesn't disprove the first part of the claim about Scarlet Witch, but for me, that was enough to move this from unconfirmed to probably not true.

But this run didn't sell as well as the originals. Whether it was disinterest in the storytelling style, the fall of comic-book stores, or the fact that Marvel didn't market it worth a damn didn't really matter. It was enough reason for Perlmutter, who was already losing his grasp over Marvel to Disney, to shove Billy and Teddy to the sidelines. While most of the other Young Avengers got solo titles or were featured prominently in other teams, Billy and Teddy were mostly ignored. They'd pop up here there but never make a real impression until they recently became media darlings once again when, 15 years after their introduction, they became featured players in 2020's *Empyre* storyline. In this, Teddy literally does become the King, or should I say Emperor of Space, coronated and all. And though the imperial court was not altogether pleased with his relationship with Billy, forbidding it at first because Billy's from Earth, not because they're gay, they did eventually have a giant royal wedding in the middle of space. A happily ever after for Marvel's premier gay couple. But is it really?

The video operates under the assumption that Perlmutter made every editorial decision at Marvel Comics. Disregarding Marvel’s support for introducing Billy and Teddy eight years before, multiple strata of editorial staff would have been involved in any publication decisions.

I’m not sure [if Billy and Teddy were ignored]. Wikipedia’s articles for both Wiccan and Hulkling list them as members of the New Avengers. Furthermore, Wiccan’s page calls him “a main character in Strikeforce” from 2019-2020.

So, one thing I talk a lot about in my videos is the representation of queer people in media. Marvel has had a bumpy road actually presenting us queer characters that stick around. There's been a few previously established characters at Marvel coming out over the last couple of years. On top of existing bisexuals like Daken, Wolverine’s son, and Deadpool, Hercules was alluded to be bisexual in the past and is now in a same-sex romance with Noh-Varr, also a Young Avenger. Wolverine himself is bisexual in an alternate universe, and Colossus is gay in an alternate universe, alternate universe being important contexts here.

Karolina Dean from Marvel's *Runaways* (which debuted in 2003) is a lesbian and was shown as such from the beginning of the comics. In the series' 2017 comic revival and TV adaptation, Karolina and her teammate Nico Minoru, who is bisexual, become a couple. I'd say they definitely stick around, and they're the first and probably most significant representation on screens for Marvel.

Iceman, both the old and young version, were outed as full-on gay in a storyline that some found touching and some found toxic. Basically, Jean Grey, a psychic, outs him to himself. <mark fc=false>This was mostly a parting “fuck you” from Brian Michael Bendis, who had been trying to add queer characters to Marvel comics for years, but Perlmutter wouldn't let him. So, as he was fixing to leave the company, he made a mainline *X-Men* character gay and, following the outline made by Heinberg, whipped up a storm of publicity about it so that Marvel would receive maximum backlash if they tried to shove him back into the closet.</mark>

Yeah, I don't have the killer quote from Bendis disproving this one, but this claim is still very dubious. First off, obviously I couldn't find any verification for it. Secondly, the timing is *really* shaky. Bendis outed Iceman two and a half years before he announced his exit from Marvel. That seems like a long gap to me for a guy supposedly in the process of quitting. Then again, I don't necessarily know how long these things take to complete and announce, so who knows. But thirdly, according to then editor-in-chief Alex Alonso, Bendis sold him on the idea just like any other storyline and they ran the idea up the ladder as per usual. So it sounds like Bendis didn't and *couldn't* run it unilaterally. And finally, it of course builds off the previous lie about Heinberg who, for the record, says that Marvel was very open to having gay characters. So all of this, no.

Beyond that, it seems to be presenting queerness with a heteronormative objective. That is, when queer characters are presented as queer either from being outed or from being out upon creation, the objective seems to be to make them as straight as possible.

And this isn't just a thing in comic books: queer characters seem to always have their queerness revolve around another character. You see this a lot in television, where, given that a cast will usually only have maybe two gay characters, they will inevitably be drawn together. It's the media version of, “Oh my god, I have a gay friend; you'd be perfect together!” This idea is so permeated in culture that many queer people try to force themselves into a relationship with potentially toxic partners because they think the only way to properly be queer is to be mated with a fellow queer.

[".... If anything the usual critique goes the other way: stable gay couples are rarely portrayed, and so gay characters are portrayed as sassy, single and promiscuous (also playing into other tropes of gayness as being full of casual sex). Or they're critiqued as being just kinda... Not really written as gay, because they don't show any interest and their identity is just a throwaway line/easily edited out single moment (the classic "diversity points" issue)"](https://twitter.com/Athena_Mewnerva/status/1788850511321424088)

["I have heard it argued that a problem with pairing off gay characters is that it limits the drama you can have with them.

Amatonormativity is definitely a thing especially for aromantic people, but most queer people (and straight people for that matter) are, well, attracted to people and desire to be in romantic relationships. I can sort of see people "forcing" themselves into relationships while they're still figuring out who they're attracted to and what kind of relationship would make them happy (though this applies to both opposite gender and same gender pairings.) But like, I think everyone, straight or gay, is kinda pressured by society to be in a stable relationship. Hell, a lot of gay people are pressured into *not* being in a relationship (i.e. the "ex-gay" movement).

And, due to the fact that the gatekeepers of media are still largely heterosexual white men, when they do deign to present queer characters, their limited understanding of queer identity is exclusively linked to white cis gay relationships rather than the internal process of thinking outside of the hetero hegemony that queer people, gay cis men and women specifically, are being badgered into.

This sentence doesn't really make sense, but is he saying that cis gay people are more "badgered into the hetero hegemony" (whatever that means) than other queer people - bisexual, transgender, non-binary, asexual, aromantic, intersex? Why would they be less subject to social pressure than cis gays? At least for bi people, "just pick one" is a common insult. Trans and non-binary people are pressured to either deny their identity or look as cis-passing as possible, intersex people are similarly forced to hide and conform and "just pick one", and aspec people are pressured to "just be normal."

Which, don't get me wrong, many people earnestly do want to get married and have a normal, white-picket-fence life with, you know, two and a half kids and a dog. The problem is that this kind of suburbanization is favorable to corporate interests, as people like this are easy to develop marketing strategies for. Specifically, mortgages, loans, cars, and other domestic products needed to keep up with the Joneses. As someone who works in marketing, I know that my fellow straight cis marketers bang their heads against the wall trying to figure out how to appeal to the city queers. They've figured out the white cis gays: gaycations, gay baby clothes, and rainbows, rainbows, rainbows! But everyone else? Well, marketing executives look at every other letter in the LGBTQIAA2+ spectrum and think, “Ah, they're just too hard to sell to, and they don't have that much money anyway.” And if there's no companies trying to convince you to buy their stuff, there's not likely anyone making media for you. But they haven't given up. Instead, there is a vested corporate interest in convincing queer people of all shades to want the lifestyle they've already figured out how to market to. Come Pride Month, if you're friends with the right kind of people, you'll hear these friends call this phenomenon rainbow capitalism, and, well, there's a whole video on that coming later.

Was he trying to say that cis gays are more "badgered into the hetero hegemony" because of... rainbow capitalism? I really don't think it's rainbow capitalism that's supposedly pushing gay people to... get married? Have children? Rainbow capitalism is more selling some merch, changing the company logo rainbow, maybe sponsoring some pride parades, maybe some more inclusive ads. Things that would appeal to most queer people. Not... special mortgages for gay couples...? I've barely even heard of gay baby clothes (conservatives certainly wouldn't be happy), or whatever a "gaycation" is. And then he claims getting married and having children is bad because... it's a marketing demographic? What?

Another factor behind the push to marry off gay characters in fiction stems from the need to de-sexualize queer characters, gay men especially. Keep in mind that the gay panic of the 20th century was rooted less in the idea that homosexuality was unnatural. The real heart of these modern phobias stemmed from the idea that gay men would use sex and gratuitous sexual pleasure to corrupt otherwise proper citizens and neighborhoods. It was called the lavender panic. “The gays are coming for your husbands, girls!” But there's a separation between the discrimination of gay men and gay women. Lesbians are, of course, discriminated against, but it's a bit different for gay men specifically because cis gay men possess the threat of penetration. Though anal sex is far from the only act the two gay men can get up to, it seems to be the only one that straight people are obsessed with. Whereas a homophobic person may have a hatred of lesbians, with gay men, there is the threat of anal penetration, and as a result, de-masculinization. And even if a fictional character's sex life never factors into the plot or components of their personality, the idea of penetrative sex still exists as a subliminal factor in the viewer's mind.

It's called the Lavender Scare, not panic. [(And seems to only have been used after-the-fact.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Scare) The main concern was that gay people were more likely to be communists or otherwise disloyal or a "security risk," because they were "twisted mentally" and "susceptible to being manipulated." (Not that they were... "coming for your husbands"?) Then he goes full Freudian in order to prove that gay men are more discriminated against than lesbians? Gay men were more targeted than lesbians during the Lavender Scare and are generally viewed more negatively than lesbians by straight men, but the Freudian stuff is... not necessary.

Single gays, therefore, are not cute or wholesome like their gay dad counterparts. They are seen as sexually deviant and, especially after the 1980s, threats to a person's health, whereas straight single characters are allowed to be as single and promiscuous as they come. Look at Wolverine, Iron Man, She-Hulk, Daredevil, Gambit, Spider-Man. I mean, the most I've ever felt seen in a comic book was DC's New 52 run of *Midnighter*, where he was literally on Grindr having on-panel gay sex with hookups and living his best single life. I mean, I wish that was my life. Single gays, men and women, seem to represent this kind of freedom, sexual and otherwise, that older creators and readers are really uncomfortable with, so now that it's okay to get gay married, they can remove this element of freedom by forcing them into a historically heterosexual institution. Suddenly, scary gays are just like the straights in the same boring, sexless marriages. The fight for equal rights and representation should not be focused around convincing the heteros that hey, these outsiders are just like you, and that means they're okay. Because then we're on a very slippery slope. When the hegemony encounters an outsider who isn't just like them and making no attempt to be, the outsider is rejected or pressured to assimilate. The focus of representation needs to be focusing on appreciating individuals’ differences, rather than focusing on finding areas of common ground.

James shows two pages when he mentions *Midnighter* - the first page is indeed from *Midnighter* #1 and depicts Midnighter's dating profile and the beginning of a date with a man named Jason. [The two hook up but decide to just be friends afterward. After this, Midnighter starts dating a man named Tony (this goes badly.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnighter_(2015_comic_book)) However, the second page is from *Midnighter and Apollo* and depicts the titular characters, who have gotten back together after breaking up. (In previous comic continuities, the two got married and adopted a kid.)

Take Billy and Teddy, for instance. Even they fit the mold of high-school nerd and high-school jock; they just happen to be gay and superheroes. But over the years, as more and more writers have gotten their hands on them, they've become only that: gay superheroes. Gay characters have their personalities stripped away.<sup cn></sup> I'm not sure whether it's because the straight writers tend to view gay as a personality or whether it's because they're so occupied making the character presentable to editors and audiences that they forget to make them interesting. As a result, the character is made to be as sterile as possible so that the majority straight, white, cis audience isn't offended. Think of it like how people say that Carol Danvers is a bitch, but Tony Stark is just snarky and determined. Traits as they are seen in straight, white, cis men are charming, but they are more negatively received in women, queer folk, and characters of color.

Something else that's very important is how Marvel and DC still sell their comics to comic book stores. Store owners get the feedback from the customers they see in store, not necessarily the majority of people who buy comics, especially now that they're available widely through apps. The people you're most likely to see in a comic book store are heteronormative white guys. In fact, the culture of most comic book stores is considered so toxic that readers who aren't white straight guys have gravitated toward buying their comics on apps like Comixology to avoid it.

Like, full disclosure: I used to follow Billy and Teddy religiously. When they would pop into the background of a comic, I would buy it, and then I would invest in the whole series. They weren't even involved. I was just so starved for the characters. But the reason I kind of fell out of touch with these guys is because I started to recognize that they were essentially ciphers that I was superimposing myself onto. As I developed as more of a distinct person, I stopped identifying with these characters because they were presented in such broad strokes that without me imagining myself in their places, Billy specifically, and without an actual distinct personality to reel me in, I didn't really have anything to keep me interested.

And that's because when these characters are written, at least most of the time, they're not being written by writers who love them, who want to expand upon their identities and build a mythology around them. They're being written by writers for whom they are just another rung on the ladder. They want to write Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Deadpool, make the jump to DC and write for Batman, the characters they grew up idolizing. And because queer media is so starved for representation, organizations like GLAAD will give an award to any writer who features queer characters. A nice feather in their cap, and a quick boost to getting to the characters that they actually want to write. Looking back at Billy and Teddy's publication, there isn't a whole lot of character there except what the reader places upon them. We know for a fact that Marvel is uncomfortable with separating them. Whenever you do see them apart, they're basically a tool to be used by a team and nothing more. There's no singular development for them. They only really exist to be put back together so that they can be “the gay couple.” Essentially, they're gays who are character baited. When straight creators write them and characters like Loki, they write them from their own heterosexual frames of reference. They have internalized the message of “they're just like me” and don't seem to make a significant attempt to make them like actual queer people, and in this feedback loop, queer readers of comic books develop their own concept of queerness as what a straight creator is trying to depict. And when queer creators are brought into Marvel, they're given a quick stint with a given character like Chavez or Iceman, and then, when the title comes to an end, they're quickly shut out from any further role in the company. Even as they're writing their queer characters, they have editors breathing down their necks, making sure this is the most palatable depiction of queerness possible. They can't authentically even tell stories about their queer experience because they have to write queerness that is directed at appealing to homophobic editors. Meanwhile, this whole process focused so hard on making gay men and women as straight as possible that we forgot to acknowledge that trans people exist, and since media has focused on almost exclusively portraying trans people who fit the binary gender mold, we're ignoring non-binary and genderqueer people.

Society convinces us to take what is different and extraordinary about us and try to hide it so that we can be “normal” and “ordinary.” But doing so, we lose what makes us special. We lose our superpower. Because trust me, queer people have superpowers. We have the superior durability to withstand years of torment and abuse. We have the telepathy needed to find each other, no matter where we might be. We have the super-strength needed to fight back against systems set up to crush us. We have the power of mind control, influencing entire societies even when they don't acknowledge that we exist. We have the ability to transform and become the people we were always meant to be. And we have the power of regeneration, to close wounds believed too deep to heal and go on with our lives. Every queer person who gets up in the morning and goes out into the world is a superhero. We may not wear capes, though some of us might, but we accomplish shocking feats. Whether we're out and proud or hidden, surviving in a land that tries to exterminate us, like so many of Marvel's X-Men, we are amazing, astounding, fantastic, spectacular, super. And I think people like that need to show up in comics, or movies, or tv shows. Queer superheroes who are every bit as astounding in everyday life as they are when they're fighting crime or saving the world. It can be done. Maybe that will be the MCU's Billy and Teddy, or maybe it's a hero yet to be created by a queer artist using their power to tell stories. Maybe it's you, because we all have a superpower, and we need to use them to make life a little bit easier for every queer kid across the world who needs a hero to look up to. I know it's a lot to take on, but we have to, because, as a great man once wrote, with great power comes great responsibility.

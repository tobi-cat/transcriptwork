James's patreon post about moving the video from YouTube to Vimeo:

> Hey there everyone,
> 
> I hope you're having a great weekend! So, as a lot of you know, my YouTube videos haven't been getting the same recommendations or views lately as they used to. Started around January when a lot of my videos, old ones and new ones, started getting hit with the dreaded 18+.
> 
> I've been informed by someone who actually has a manager who works with YouTube that when you have multiple 18+ videos on your channel, the algorithm stops recommending your channel to people under 18, and even stops recommending them to people over 18 who don't usually watch 18+ content. But it can possibly be fixed by deleting your 18+ stuff (unlisted and private isn't good enough). So I'm going to do that tonight.
> 
> Some of my videos that have been hit are so random, like Part 2 of the Camp video series (even though the full series as one video is perfectly fine), and yet my video about the history of gay porn (which talks about porn, underage porn, and murder) is also perfectly fine. 
> 
> Anyway!
>
> I don't want you guys going without access to the videos. They wouldn't exist without you. Hell, my channel as a whole wouldn't exist without you! So I've put them up on Vimeo and you can find the links below. Hopefully this will clear up the mess and my channel will go back to normal with the next video? Hopefully? Fingers Crossed.

Hey guys. I'm just in the process of editing the video that you're about to watch, and I thought I would drop a *severe* content warning right here. It's... it's a lot. Obviously, there's discussion of the murder of queer people. That's what the video's about. But there's also instances of audio that was taken from the killers, one of which they consistently refer to a trans woman as "he." I've made sure to keep any kind of deadnaming or anything like that out of there.

But I just wanted you to know that that's there. There's some violent shots. There's some, a couple of kind of brutal images as well, because I really wanted to get the point across. So, you know, if you feel like you need to take a break watching it or anything like that, by all means. Oh, also, for a lot of the victims, there's not a lot of pictures of them.

There's not a lot of pictures. There's not a lot of... definitely not a lot of video. So for a lot of instances, I've used shots from movies that may have been made about the case. But you'll notice a lot, especially in the last section where I'm talking about attacks on trans women, that there's very little... there's very few photos even.

In early February 2008, in Oxnard, California, a 15 year old named Larry asked a fellow eighth grader named Brandon to be their valentine. Somehow, our society had given Brandon the impression that this innocent request was tantamount to a criminal offense. And so on February 12th, Brandon murdered Larry, shooting them twice in the back of the head. The first trial ended in a mistrial with several members of the jury agreeing with the defense's use of queer panic, stating that by Larry coming on to Brandon, they were essentially bullying him, leaving him with no choice but to kill the 15 year old.

On February 12th, an openly gay 15-year-old boy named Larry who was an eighth-grader in Oxnard, California was murdered by a fellow eighth-grader named Brandon. Larry was killed because he . . . was gay. Days before he was murdered, Larry asked his killer to be his Valentine . . . . And somewhere along the line the killer Brandon got the message that it’s so threatening and so awful and so horrific that Larry would want to be his Valentine that killing Larry seemed to be the right
thing to do. And when the message out there is [that it is] so horrible . . . to be gay you can be killed for it, we need to change the message.

The queer panic, or better known as gay or trans panic, defense has been a legal defense tactic for three quarters of a century in the United States and abroad. The murder of Larry in 2008 is just a recent and particularly venomous example and may actually fall under both gay and trans panic. Though Larry presented as a boy, many people who knew them stated after their death that they wanted to change their name to Latisha and possibly transition.

We won't know if Larry would have ever done that, though, because they only spent 15 years on this earth before rabid hatred took them from us all. I wish Larry was the only example of this. I wish queer panic was an obscure mention in a dusty legal book somewhere. But there's a sad, dark histoy to this rationalization of hate masquerading as a legal defense.

<mark>The use of queer panic in murder cases has its roots in theories of latent homosexuality as a mental disorder. The term homosexual panic was coined by Dr. Edward Kempf, a clinical psychiatrist, in 1920. After treating many patients who exhibited similar characteristics, Kempf came to the conclusion that certain troubled individuals who thought of themselves as heterosexuals were actually latent homosexuals. These individuals suffered from an internal conflict between their feelings of attraction to people of the same sex and societal views of such feelings as perverse. They also experienced a heightened sense of anxiety in same sex environments, caused by this tension.</mark>

He then placed a sensor on the penises of all the participants, and measured penile response to erotic videotapes involving heterosexuals, lesbians, and gay men engaging in sexual activity. Only the men in Adams's homophobic category showed an increase in penile erection in response to male homosexual erotic stimuli.<sup>49</sup>

Kempf's study has since been used to back up the use of the queer panic defense that latent homosexuality is in and of itself a mental disorder, therefore excusing the defendant as being not in control of their own faculties. By using the gay panic defense, they are essentially admitting to be latently queer themselves. A nuance many of the defendants, I'm sure, are unaware of.

Even if some self-identified straight men who express strongly negative feelings about homosexuality are actually latent homosexuals repressing their own homoerotic desires, the idea that gay panic should excuse the killing of a gay man is problematic for several reasons. First, treating gay panic as a mental disorder suggests that homophobia<sup>50</sup> linked to latent homosexuality is a mental illness.<sup>51</sup> Studies, however, indicate that negative attitudes about homosexuality tend to come from two sources: sexual conservatism and prejudice.<sup>52</sup> Although some mental health practitioners might feel otherwise,<sup>53</sup> sexually conservative individuals and prejudiced individuals are not necessarily mentally ill.

<comment> 

James seems to be taking the "latent homosexuality is a mental illness" fragment and running with it. First of all, that wasn't Kempf's study, it was Henry Adams' study, Kempf just had theories based on his practice. Second of all, the study, which was from 1996, has not been used to argue that "latent homosexuality is a mental illness," because homosexual panic and homosexuality have not been considered mental disorders, at least in the DSM, since the early 70s. [Homosexual panic, as a disorder, and the homosexual panic defense, are distinct, because a person using the homosexual panic defense is typically arguing *temporary* insanity (or provocation or self defense), not that they have a mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense#Use_of_the_gay_panic_defense). I guess you *could* argue that people who use the gay panic defense are admitting to being latently queer, based on the term's origin, but that's really a stretch, and it's pretty homophobic to imply that everyone who uses the gay panic defense is gay themselves. Or maybe he's just saying it's ironic that a heterosexual homophobe is accidentally admitting to being gay, I don't know.

Gay panic in and of itself is a useless defense. It must be attached to something more meaty, something you can win over a jury with. 

<mark>Excuse or justification. <u>[Title card with A|Excuse or justification appears.]</u></mark> <mark>An excuse defense is one in which the defendant's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but that he himself is not seen as morally at fault. A justification defense, on the other hand, focuses on the defendant's conduct more than his individual characteristics. A justification defense argues that the attacker's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.</mark>

<mark>*A. Excuse or Justification?*</mark>

A preliminary question is whether gay panic, if allowed as a defense argument, should be recognized as an excuse or a justification. An excuse defense is one in which the actor's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but the actor himself is not seen as morally blameworthy.<sup>75</sup> A justification defense, in contrast, focuses on the actor's conduct more than the individual characteristics of the actor.<sup>76</sup> A justification defense says the actor's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.<sup>77</sup> Examples of excuse defenses include insanity, duress, and intoxication. Necessity, self-defense, and defense of others are usually considered justification defenses.

Truthfully, <mark>it's difficult to argue that queer panic should be called either a justification or an excuse.

<mark>It is difficult to argue that gay panic should be called either a justification or an excuse. Justification suggests the defendant did the right thing or took the course of action that society would have wanted him to take.</mark> A man who kills a gay man just because that man made a pass at him does not act the way a civilized society should want its men to act.<sup>78</sup> Gay panic should not be recognized as a justification defense.

<mark>An excuse defense suggests that the defendant is not as morally blameworthy</mark> as one who does the same action without the excusing condition. It is difficult to say that the man who kills a gay man in response to a non-violent homosexual advance is not as morally blameworthy <mark>as someone who kills for any other reason.</mark>

<sup>78</sup> If the victim does more than just make a pass - if, for example, the victim tries to forcibly rape the defendant, then ordinary self-defense principles would allow the defendant to protect himself from the imminent threat of grievous bodily injury.

No, attorneys have to argue excuse or justification, or they're not going to get anywhere with a gay panic defense. The text literally says that out of the gay panic defense arguments, "provocation is a partial excuse defense, self-defense is a justification defense, and insanity and diminished capacity are excuse defenses."

<mark>There are several problems with defense attempts to claim insanity linked to gay panic.

The pair were friends with both Kerouac and Burroughs, who both reportedly had a crush on the young Carr.

James changes first-degreee to second-degree, presumably because the Medium article says "he pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter." I looked but I couldn't find which one he actually pleaded. I suspect it was first-degree manslaughter because it makes more sense from what I read about New York laws; second-degree manslaughter, also called reckless homicide, is when you unintentionally cause someone else's death through reckless behavior, while first-degree manslaughter is when you intentionally kill someone while in a state of "extreme emotional disturbance."

<mark>Simpson never made it to his date. It is believed that on the way there he was propositioned by a young man named Charles Lawrence on the side of the road. Unknown to Simpson, Lawrence was notorious for "rolling" gay men (as local media called it then) - luring them to a secluded spot where his accomplice, Lewis Killen, would jump out and help rob the victim.</mark>

And also that's just ridiculous on its face, juries don't *boo*, that'd be an instant mistrial. Please find me *any* instance of this happening anywhere ever. Also the jury sided with the prosecutor, why would they have booed him for proving that gay panic wasn't a real thing? I don't understand what this detail is even supposed to mean.

<mark fc=false>Parisie was convicted of manslaughter, but upon appeal was set free. The appeals court stated that <q>"By not allowing more witnesses to testify that Robert Jackson was homosexual, but allowing Jackson's wife to speak, the original judge allowed too much doubt to seep in. If the jury were completely convinced of his perversities, a full acquittal would have been likely."</q> And so John Stephan Parisie was let back into the world, a world Robert Jackson no longer lived in.</mark>

So it is true that after 14 years in prison, Parisie did win his appeal in 1982, partially because of the suppressed witnesses. However, this quote right here, the one where the judge calls the dead gay man a pervert and said his perversions would have led to an acquittal - I am almost certain that this quote is *completely fabricated*. It does *not* appear in the source he's pulling from, and it does not appear in any of the court rulings, of which there were several. It's possible that I just don't know my way around legal documents well enough to find the source of this quote, but also just on basic logic, I don't buy it. The gay Panic defense is used to get *leniency*, not acquittal. Somerton says that himself earlier in the video. 

And it's definitely not likely that Parisie would have been acquitted. Parisie said beforehand that he was gonna go quote "roll a queer" because he needed the money, and when he was arrested, he was in possession of the victim's wallet, wedding ring, and car. Plus, the prosecutor debunked "gay panic" as made up anyway, so even with the testimony, I don't buy that he would have been acquitted. A judge did not say that. [On screen: "The problem with quotes found on the Internet is that they are often not true." - Abraham Lincoln ] 

Finally, I did consult with some lawyers about these court documents - thank you Devin LegalEagle and @jewishlawyerlib on Twitter - and based on what they told me, I think the entire conclusion of this segment is wrong. That's not Somerton's fault, the source he's using misinterpreted the case, but what actually happened was: Parisie won the right to a *retrial* in 1982. Not his freedom, just a retrial.However, the state appealed that ruling and a year later the court changed its mind based on like, minor procedural stuff, like Parisie missed a filing deadline somewhere along the line. So, the first appeal was overturned and the original guilty verdict stood; Parisie did not get his retrial. 

And again that's not Somerton's fault, his source was wrong, but the embellishments he added, those *do* belong to him, and they make the initial error much worse. The prosecutor had argued that the victim probably wasn't even gay, and one appeals judge thought, if you're gonna call this guy a liar, he has the right to prove you wrong. If you think there were maybe some biased undertones to that decision, you know what, go ahead and make that case, but the decision was about the right to a fair trial, not whether it's okay to murder "perverts." He's once again fabricating evidence to support someone else's conclusion, which in this case wasn't even valid. 

</comment>
<comment>

Also, Reggie (and then James) claims that Parisie was convicted for manslaughter, but none of the records of the case I could find mentioned manslaughter, only murder. It wouldn't make sense anyway; manslaughter wouldn't get a 40 to 70 year sentence, the sentence length that Reggie claims.

Over the next twenty years, the gay panic defense was used regularly<sup cn></sup> in American courtrooms, but not just in the murder of gay men. Because defendants often received reduced sentences when claiming gay panic, *many* murderers began claiming gay panic even when the victim was, <span stat:id="baa">by all accounts</span>, straight.<sup cn></sup> It was an easy way to have a sentence reduced<sup cn></sup> from murder to manslaughter, death penalties to prison time. A defense that prosecutors *loathed*, that gay rights organizations *fought* to end the use of, but that was roundly ignored by the general population. Most people had never *heard* of gay panic or the gay panic defense. It was just a... *relatively* obscure temporary insanity plea that most people would never need to know existed. But gay panic would eventually get national attention.

As Cynthia Lee states, the gay panic defense generally did not work as a temporary insanity plea (491-494). I'm not sure if there's even one case of it working as a temporary insanity plea, though there were cases of it working as a diminished capacity plea.

Scott Amedure. Scott Amedure was a military veteran who appeared on *The Jenny Jones Show* in 1995 at the age of 32. <mark>The Jenny Jones Show was a daytime tabloid talk show that ran for 12 years between 1991 and 2003.

For example, Jenny Jones would bring in a woman who slept with a married man and his wife, encouraging them to confront one another in front of her live studio audience. She'd surprise a couple with a paternity test result on air, have spouses reveal affairs and break up with their partners, bring in unruly teenagers who needed discipline, and reveal *secret* same sex crushes.</mark>

[James is exagerrating *far* beyond what actually happened in the civil trial.](https://www.courttv.com/title/56-amedure-v-jenny-jones-allyn-schmitz-pt3/) Schmitz's father was homophobic and he was angry about the Jenny Jones incident. He *speculated* that Schmitz may have killed Amedure because he didn't want people thinking he was gay. But there is no clear indication that he *coerced* Schmitz into killing Amedure, why would he admit to that if he had done that? Like, he *could* have I guess, but I don't know, it just seems implausible. It feels like the prosecutor was just trying to insinuate that to improve his case.

LGBT advocate groups fought hard to bring attention to the legally unsound gay panic defense that had been utilized, but people simply weren't interested. It had only been a few years since the supposedly liberal Clinton administration had banned gay men from serving in the military and banned same sex marriage federally, to high approval ratings among the American public. In the late 1990s, there was far more sympathy for those who murdered queer people than there was for the queer people being murdered. A sad reality that was about to be shaken one night in Laramie, Wyoming.

</james>
<comment>

Clinton's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy also banned out lesbians and bisexual people, as well as openly gay men, from serving in the military; I'm not sure why James is specifying gay men, it wasn't specific to gay men. Maybe he thinks women weren't in the military at that time, but they definitely were. And LGBT people couldn't serve in the miliitary before DADT either.

Clinton's Defense of Marriage Act prevented federal recognition of same sex marriage and allowed states to refuse to recognize same sex marriages performed in other states. The way James phrases it, it sounds like he thinks that it banned same sex marriage everywhere in the country, which it did not.

<mark>On the night of October 6, 1998, Shepard was approached by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie;</mark> all three men were in their early 20s.<sup>[11][9]</sup> <mark>McKinney and Henderson offered to give Shepard a ride home.<sup>[12][13]</sup> They subsequently drove to a remote rural area and proceeded to rob, pistol-whip, and torture Shepard,</mark> tying him to a barbed-wire fence and leaving him to die. <mark>Many media reports contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. Reports described how Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except where it had been partially cleansed by his tears.<sup>[10][14][15]</sup></mark>

The medical gloves issued by the Albany County Sheriff's Department were faulty, and Fluty's supply ran out. She decided to use her bare hands to clear an airway in Shepard's bloody mouth. A day later, she was informed that Shepard was HIV-positive and that she might have been exposed to the virus due to cuts on her hands. After taking an AZT regimen for several months, she tested negative for HIV.<sup>[21]</sup> Judy Shepard later wrote that she learned of her son's HIV status while he lay dying in the hospital.<sup>[22]</sup>

In the opening remarks of the trial of Aaron McKinney in the fall of 1999, McKinney's defense launched an all-out offense on the myth of Saint Matthew. In a familiar pattern of the gay panic defense, they attacked Shepard's conduct, his lifestyle, his sexual experiences, his morals and everything else that might sway a jury. The judge refused to even entertain the notion of gay panic. And so the defense team changed strategies - <mark fc=false>they would instead argue that Matthew's murder was justified, publicly announcing that he was HIV positive and therefore a danger to the entire community, that he was a sexual predator.</mark> But their smears weren't sticking. For McKinney's lawyers, the greatest threat to their defense was an emerging memory of Matthew Shepard as a valued, respected and likable person.

<comment>

I am certain that Somerton made up the part about "Matthew's murder was justified" - I found no record of such a "defense" being used, and I'm sure it would have been a big deal if it had been used. The Westboro protesters were saying those things, not the defense attorneys. I'm not sure if most of the earlier attacks on Shepard (minus accusing Shepard of propositioning McKinney) actually happened either; from what I read of the trial, the defense mostly focused on explaining how McKinney's drug and alcohol use and trauma from sexual abuse led to him "snapping" when Shepard supposedly propositioned him, and that he hadn't intended to kill him when he beat him. It is true, though, that a gay panic defense was made and the judge refused to consider it. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov99/shepard110199.htm) (https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/hatecrimes/stories/shepard102699.htm)

For the first time, legal professionals and the American public were wholly rejecting the gay panic defense. The far right Christians who had called for retribution early on were now actively protesting alongside the LGBT community.<sup cn></sup> Outliers like the Westboro Baptist Church were shunned as Christians were forced to face the fact that their idea of hate the sin, love the sinner, was putting them on the wrong side of a social battle.

<mark>Religious leaders also weighed in. Although they could have framed Shepard and the attack using a religious perspective, they also maintained the same secular focus and avoided any religious language. Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, described Shepard as a member of "our human community" and as "our brother" and decried a national "climate of hate" that "makes such a crime possible." </mark>He did not, unlike the president's statement, request prayers on Shepard's behalf, nor, as might be expected from a cleric, did Griswold mention Shepard might be in heaven. <mark>Dignity/USA, a gay Catholic organization, declared: "the murder of Matthew Shepard is an extreme example of a hate motivated crime."</mark> Yet, it also contained no mention of prayers for the young man. An exception to this trend, however, came from the Metropolitan Community Church. Troy Perry firmly declared: "Matt has truly 'slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.'" This image of Shepard in the presence of God, then, was the exception that proved the rule. Only Perry was willing to depart from a secular construction of Shepard to broach a religious one, although without the language of popular martyrdom. On the whole, the media and prominent public leaders - including many religious leaders - tended to cast Shepard and the attack in a secular light.<sup>25</sup>

McKinney's trial took place in October and November 1999. Prosecutor Cal Rerucha alleged that McKinney and Henderson pretended to be gay to gain Shepard's trust. Price, McKinney's girlfriend, testified that Henderson and McKinney had "pretended they were gay to get [Shepard] in the truck and rob him."<sup>[12][33]</sup> McKinney's lawyer attempted to put forward a gay panic defense, arguing that McKinney was driven to temporary insanity by alleged sexual advances by Shepard. This defense was rejected by the judge. McKinney's lawyer stated that the two men wanted to rob Shepard but never intended to kill him.<sup>[9]</sup> Rerucha argued that the killing had been premeditated, driven by "greed and violence", rather than by Shepard's sexual orientation.<sup>[34]</sup> <mark>The jury found McKinney not guilty of premeditated murder but guilty of felony murder and began to deliberate on the death penalty.

The death of Matthew did not fade from public memory. *The Laramie Project*, a play chronicling the murder and trial, premiered in 2000. A film adaptation of the play was released in 2002, as well as a TV movie, *The Matthew Shepard Story*. Multiple books have been written about the event, and countless documentaries and TV specials have told the story of Matthew's death. But it wasn't until his mother, Judy, published the book *The Meaning of Matthew* in 2010 that we really got to learn about his life.

Multiple allegations against Matthew have risen in recent years, with many police officers working on the case early on, saying that it was not a hate crime but a drug murder, that Matthew was a meth dealer, though other officers vehemently disagree with this attack. In 2013, a book entitled *The Book of Matt* was released that claimed Matthew to be a meth-dealing, heroin-addicted prostitute that had multiple sexual encounters with his killers. The author, Steven Jimenez, has been decried by LGBT rights organizations, politicians, media figures and everyone who knew Matt. In an interview, Jimenez said, <q>"This does not make the perfect poster boy for the gay-rights movement. Which is a big part of the reason my book has been so trashed."</q>

The only places I could find this full quote online was at [murderpedia](https://murderpedia.org/male.B/b/butler-Charles.htm) and on page 79 of Cynthia Lee's *Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom* (2007). (They found the quote in the same place, a 1999 article at CourtTV by Bryan Robinson than seems to have been erased from the Internet.) Charles Butler actually withdrew his mental defect defense before the trial and instead argued that he had not killed Billy himself, Steven Mullins had done that alone, though "gay panic" was still featured in the trial.

The judge refused to accept it. Both men were sentenced to life in prison. And in 2019, 20 years after he beat Billy Jack Gaither to death, Steven Mullins was stabbed to death in prison. Charles Butler remains in prison. 

Ever since his death, there has been a memorial held in honor of Billy Jack on the steps of the Alabama State House. State reps and congresspeople fought for almost 20 years to have the murder of LGBT people considered a hate crime in Alabama. As of November 2021, according to state law, murdering a gay man in Alabama is still not considered a hate crime.

According to AL.com, Democratic state representative Patricia Todd was Alabama's first openly lesbian lawmaker.

The Wikipedia ID is from February 2021 because that was the last version before all of the gay panic examples were removed from the article.

The gay men have not been the only victims of the queer panic defense, often ignored by the media of the murders of trans women, especially trans women of color. Though in many cases their killers are never caught and in some cases never even really looked for. Sometimes these women's killers do end up in court where queer panic becomes the backbone of their defense. I debated whether to keep the following section in the video as transgender people begin to be acknowledged by society. They've also received the entirely wrong kind of attention, especially trans women of color.

And I cannot speak for those women. My life experience as a cisgender gay man who passes for straight is all too different. Though I have feared the wrath of homophobes from time to time. I've never had to live with the all-encompassing fear of violence that so many trans women deal with every day. The murder of trans women has become all too frequent, and much like gun violence, they're rarely reported by the media.

Their deaths are left painfully vague to the point where it's easier to find information on their killers than on the women themselves. In many cases, they go unreported entirely because the police investigating the murders identify these women by their birth sex and deadnames, essentially erasing them from public record. These women fight to be accepted for who they truly are in life just to have that taken away from them in death. A final blow from a society so unwilling to acknowledge them. I cannot begin to relate to the fear that these women live with every day. That a sideways glance from a man on the street might mean their death. But I know so many women deal with this fear on a daily basis, and so many others aren't here anymore to tell us about it.

Magidson’s defense involved an implicit acknowledgment of his role in Araujo’s death, but argued that Magidson acted in the heat of passion,</mark><mark> and therefore, should be found guilty of manslaughter, not murder, under California law. Merel’s attorney denied any involvement by Merél in the killing. Cazares, the only defendant to testify at that first trial</mark> and the only defendant who never had a physical relationship with Araujo, <mark>denied involvement but admitted to help burying Araujo.</mark> Prosecution witnesses pointed out that Cazares attempted to intervene on behalf of Araujo (to stop the beating) on as many as five separate occasions prior to everyone fleeing the house. <mark>All three attacked Nabors’ credibility, arguing that he minimized his own role in Gwen’s death and had the most to gain by lying. The jury deadlocked on all three defendants, and a mistrial was recorded.</mark> The jury appeared to be unable to decide whether the murders were premeditated, and so whether to convict them of first degree murder or second degree murder. However, another possibility — one that the prosecution appeared to respond to in the second trial — was that the prosecution’s lack of a coherent theory as to who was responsible for what role in Araujo’s death made it impossible for the jurors to determine who of the three, if any, was guilty.

<mark>In contrast to the first trial, where only Cazares testified, all three defendants testified in this trial — and blamed each other as well as Nabors.</mark> However, Jose Merel conceded (like the prosecution witnesses) that Cazares intervened on behalf of Araujo during the beating. Magidson claimed to have blacked out during the beating and was unable to recall whether Cazares intervened. Cazares again claimed to be only involved in burying Araujo. No witnesses ever testified to seeing Cazares strike the victim in any manner. Jose Merél blamed Nabors as the main killer, and indicated that Magidson helped Nabors strangle Araujo to death; Merél acknowledged hitting Araujo over the head with a pan, but claimed he never wanted to kill her. Magidson also largely blamed Nabors, but also claimed to be heavily intoxicated the night of Araujo’s death. Jose Merel and Mike Magidson said that Jaron Nabors struck Gwen in the head with a barbell weight, which had not previously been disclosed. A weight from the house was brought into court and did show a presumptively positive test for blood. Nabors denied that anyone used a weight to strike Gwen. Nabors’ girlfriend also testified about the letter she received from Nabors while she was in custody. She testified that the letter contained a number of factual accounts that were lies, and that Nabors often lied to her.

<mark>Prosecutor Chris Lim Yero appeared to abandon the strategy that the prosecution employed in the first trial - blaming all three defendants equally for the crime and arguing hard only for first degree murder - and instead concentrated his argument against Magidson, calling him a pathetic, despicable excuse for a man.

On August 24, 2005, closing argument commenced. <mark>Prosecutor Chris Lamiero appeared to abandon the strategy that the prosecution employed in the first trial - blaming all three defendants equally for the crime and arguing hard only for first degree murder - and instead concentrated his argument against Magidson, calling him a "pathetic, despicable excuse for a man”. As for Cazares, Lamiero argued that his assistance of Magidson made him as culpable as Magidson for murder.</mark> He repeatedly referred to Cazares as "the killer’s friend” during his argument. Lamiero further appeared to concede that the murder might not be first degree murder, by arguing that the most important thing for the jury is to find Magidson and Cazares guilty of murder, either first degree or second degree. Lamiero’s closing arguments appeared to leave Merél entirely out of his fire - stating merely that Merél’s fate was up to the jury. This may be because Merél’s testimony, if believed, would tend to establish Magidson’s and Cazares’ guilt.

In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, juror Max Stern, a San Francisco attorney, indicated that the jury did not particularly believe any of the defendants or prosecution witness Nabors. He indicated that the jury believed that the offense was murder rather than manslaughter because the jurors believed that Magidson and Merél’s reactions were not reasonable, but rejected the hate crime enhancement because some jurors did not believe that the crime was committed because of Araujo’s sexual orientation, but because the situation got out of hand. According to Stern, the jury convicted Magidson and Merél largely based on their admissions of their roles in Araujo’s death.

Unlike many transgender women who disappear or are murdered, Angie had not been abandoned by her family. She was deeply loved by them and her countless friends.

Angie is sorely missed, most by her mother, but by friends and family as well, by coworkers and acquaintances but she'll always be remembered not just as the sweet soul that she was in life, but in the lingering impact of her death being the first time that the murder of a trans woman was tried as a hate crime and saw a successful conviction that she cracked that already shaky bedrock on which the trans panic defense rests.

Many judges today reject the defense immediately, and many juries will hold it against the defense for trying to use it. There's a stigma against the defense now, even if it is still perfectly legal in 39 states. But just because jurors and judges may dismiss the use of queer panic, it's not a sure thing. The only way to ensure that justice is achieved in the murder of queer people is to enact a legislative ban on the gay and trans panic defenses, something <mark fc=false>11 states</mark> have done.

Do away with it once and for all to show the homophobic and transphobic, hateful bigots that know it is not okay to kill people for being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or gender non-conforming. Our lives mean just as much as everyone else's.

You will not get away with killing us. You will not get a reduced sentence for killing us. Every year across America, people are killed for being who they are. They're killed because of the fragile masculinity of little men. Their lives ended in brutal, ugly nightmares because some their lives are worth nothing. That they won't be missed. That once they're dead and gone, their names will fade into obscurity.

Because for decades, centuries, that's what's happened. Our names were lost, our lives forgotten. But we will not forget. We cannot forget the names. Lives of the people lost to homophobia and transphobia. The sons and daughters whose parents will never see grow up. The people who have fallen to these crimes, the so-called panic. They were already taken away from US ones.

We have to make sure it doesn't happen again. So mourn their deaths and celebrate their lives, and most importantly, remember their names. Because now is the time to mourn those we've lost and fight like hell for those we've still got.

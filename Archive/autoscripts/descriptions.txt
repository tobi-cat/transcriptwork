Birdcage Watch-along.mov

Hey everyone! We had our first patron watch-along today watching The Birdcage and we actually had a lot of fun. I recorded it for anyone missed the live stream but wants to watch. The audio is a bit hit or miss, but not too bad considering this is the first time we've tried this lol. The video is available above via Google Drive (I promise there's no viruses lol) since YouTube would have a conniption if I uploaded a full movie, even unlisted. 

We'll be doing another watch-along for Kill Bill when Nick is town later this month. Let me know what time of day is best for everyone. :-)

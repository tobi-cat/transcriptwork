This video was originally released on July 20th, 2020. In the Patreon Post announcing it, James claims to have accidentally publicly released it, and it was supposed to be Patreon-exclusive for a while.

On September 5th, 2020, James was called out by someone about how this video plagiarized whole pages from *Tinker Belles and Evil Queens* by Sean Griffin. James promptly took the video down and sent an email to Griffin asking if he could use the video. He put the video back up on September 10th with added crediting in the video's opening title sequence.

Sean Griffin himself [wrote a blog post](https://www.fromthesquare.org/how-my-book-became-the-subject-of-a-youtube-scandal-by-sean-griffin/) [[archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20240217204808/https://www.fromthesquare.org/how-my-book-became-the-subject-of-a-youtube-scandal-by-sean-griffin/)] about the whole experience from his perspective. He didn't want to get dragged into this drama against his will. (Griffin has turned down HBomberGuy's offer to be compensated, as he was not struggling financially.)

On November 8, 2018, Disney's CEO Bob Iger announced Disney's latest world conquering venture, Disney Plus. A digital streaming service, dubbed a "Netflix killer" by many in the media, that would make almost all of Disney's content streamable in one place. 

<u>[The DVD cover of *Song of the South* appears.]</u> Not you, we don't talk about you!

Big draws to the service were announcements of original series focusing on Disney's Marvel and Star Wars brands, with *Falcon and the Winter Soldier*, *WandaVision*, *Loki*, and *The Mandalorian* being revealed, though only *The Mandalorian* had a planned release date anytime soon. Alongside the Disney owned brands would live content from companies the mouse had recently acquired, namely 20th Century Fox. The fraught buyout of Fox had played out in entertainment reporting for months with most of the Internet being in favor of the potential ever growing monopoly, since it would mean Marvel's X-Men and Fantastic 4 would be under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige at Disney.

<james {% include timecode %}>

But along with the mutants, Disney acquired *hundreds* of other properties from Fox including, *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, which they've duly ignored ever since, and the film rights to the novel *Simon vs. the Homo Sapien<sup class="add">[sic: Sapiens]</sup> Agenda* by Becky Albertali, a young adult novel about a teenage gay romance that had been adapted into a hit film earlier that year. Unlike *Rocky Horror*, Disney saw potential with *Love, Simon*'s family-friendly representation of gay teens and announced a sequel streaming series as one of its main hooks to Disney Plus.

You see, Disney fully intended their streaming service to compete with Netflix, the dominant force in the streaming game, since it became a thing, and something Netflix had become well known for was their LGBT inclusive content. Whether it was original shows like *Orange is the New Black* *Sense8*, *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*, and *Grace and Frankie*, or their *extensive* library of queer films, Netflix had pretty much cornered the LGBT streaming market. And Disney wanted a piece of it. According to *The Hollywood Reporter*, Disney has a massive amount of data pointing toward them being *incredibly* popular among the LGBT community.<sup cn></sup> And so, they wanted to play into that by creating *Love, Victor*. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The company pushed Disney Plus's annual subscription early on, locking audiences into a full year's worth of membership before the vast majority of their original content had even begun production, and one of its big selling points was the diversity representation of *Love, Victor*. According to market research, approximately 3.5 *million* initial subscribers to Disney Plus were LGBT.<sup cn></sup> Obviously, *Love, Victor* wasn't the sole reason reason for these people subscribing, but I'm willing to bet that it certainly helped boost those numbers.

Disney Plus went live in November of 2019, with *The Mandalorian* being their only major draw. Casting and production news surrounding *Love, Victor* had regularly trended on social media, and the upcoming series was considered Disney's next safe bet after *The Mandalorian* ran its course. 

</james>
<from></from>

<james {% include timecode %}>

But then, in February of 2020, things changed. Disney announced that *Love, Victor* would not be appearing on Disney Plus, despite selling people on it from the very beginning. Instead, it would stream on the also Disney-owned Hulu, a service with half as many subscribers, and one not available almost anywhere outside the United States. 

Their reasoning? *Deadline* reported that executives at Disney thought *Love, Victor* wasn't family friendly enough for the brand. I wonder what wasn't family friendly enough about it...? 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

Note that in February 2020, [Disney Plus](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-worldwide-1234925654/) and [Hulu](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258014/number-of-hulus-paying-subscribers/) had similar numbers of subscribers. At the time of this video's initial release, Disney Plus had more subscribers but not quite twice as many (~60 million versus Hulu's ~35.5 million).

James seems to be referring to [this](https://deadline.com/2020/02/love-simon-spinoff-series-love-victor-moves-from-disney-to-hulu-premiere-date-opens-season-2-writers-room-1202866549/) article, though he never shows it.

One needs to ask, what would it have meant for a generation of queer kids to see a show representing them on a *Disney* platform? You don't get much more mainstream than Disney. That might have given hope to queer kids who are held down by their homophobic or transphobic families or communities.

And while many queer youth avoided *Love, Simon* in theaters for fear of being spotted seeing a gay movie,<sup cn></sup> this TV sequel could have allowed them to take in a cute gay teen comedy from the comfort of their own laptop or phone. A possibility made all the more likely with how popular *Love, Simon* has been on streaming.

With Disney Plus in almost 50 million households by the time *Love, Victor* was released this June, that would have been a gigantic potential audience. But Hulu isn't in as nearly many homes. It isn't nearly as mainstream. Disney had the opportunity to say to those gay kids, "your stories are as good as anyone else's," but now, by shafting it over to Hulu, the Mouse has unequivocably<sup class="add">[sic: unequivocally]</sup> said, "you don't belong here."

<mark fc=false>According to Hulu, *Love, Victor* was its most binged show of 2020,</mark> which is pretty impressive considering how we've all been locked up with little more to do than stream TV shows. So not only did Disney segregate the queer audience to a smaller platform, but it missed out on a hit series, something the service is in desperate need of, with data showing that aside from *The Mandalorian*, none of Disney Plus's original content has been a hit. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

No, it was ["the most-binged **original drama** series on Hulu in 2020 **during its first week** and the second most-binged original on Hulu placing behind *Solar Opposites*."](https://www.eonline.com/news/1166338/turns-out-love-victor-felt-quite-a-bit-of-viewer-love-on-hulu) This video was released in July 2020, you wouldn't be able to say anything definitive about the most-binged shows over the entire year anyway.

When Disney made the announcement that *Love, Victor* was being sent to Hulu, I was... frustrated, but not shocked. I was frustrated that even in 2020, queer people aren't considered family friendly enough for Disney. But I wasn't shocked... because Disney has an out-and-proud history of using and abusing the LGBT community for its own means. In order to talk about *that*, we'll need to discuss Disney's prolific history of queer coding villains, straight-washing heroes, and pandering to the LGBT community just to ignore us once they have our money.

## Part One: The Days of Uncle Walt

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Gay culture has always held the Disney oeuvre in high regard, but why exactly? To say that Disney was queer coding in the early days would be a bit disingenuous. I hardly believe that good ol' Uncle Walt, hater of all things subversive, would insert queer coded messages into his early
animated films, although six hairy men in one twink living together is a bit suspect. 

But queer readings of Disney films *are* possible and quite well known. Really, it all comes down to fantasy.

Funnily enough, <mark fc=false>Walt Disney fought hard to get the film rights to *The Wizard of Oz*</mark> but failed. He would rarely let the rights to something he wanted slip through his fingers ever again. 

</james>
<comment id="oz_rights" {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

I found this claim on a fandom site and a blog site and tracked it down to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_the_Great_and_Powerful#cite_ref-19). I looked at the citation for the Wikipedia claim, which is [a documentary on the making of *The Wizard of Oz*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4UYr2ON5SM) The narrator, Angela Lansbury, says that the production of the movie was influenced by the success of Disney's *Snow White* and that MGM bought the rights in 1938, but there's no mention of Disney trying to buy the rights at that time, though Disney would buy the rights to the rest of Baum's *Oz* books in the 50s and make several adaptations over the years.

<mark>There are two early Disney shorts about outsiders, though, that are more easily read as specifically gay texts and delightfully affirming of otherness. The first of these is the Oscar-winning short *Ferdinand the Bull* from 1937.</mark> <mark>The cartoon tells the story of a young bull who is content to spend his life "just sitting quietly and smelling the flowers" rather than going after other more conventionally masculine pursuits. While Ferdinand has never shown having romantic interest in another bull, the character's quiet affection for flowers associates him with images of gay men in American culture at the time. You see, in the 1920s and 30s, gay men were frequently referred to as "pansies" or "buttercups." </mark>

<mark>There are two Disney texts about outsiders, though, that are more easily read as specifically “gay” texts and delightfully affirming of “otherness.” The first of these is the Oscar-winning short *Ferdinand the Bull* (1937).</mark> With backgrounds depicting a constantly sunny Spain, <mark>the cartoon tells the story of a young bull who is content to spend his life “just sitting quietly and smelling the flowers” rather than pursuing other more conventionally masculine pursuits. While Ferdinand is never shown having sexual interest in another bull, the character’s quiet affection for flowers associates him with images of homosexuals then current in American culture. In the 1920s and ’30s, gay men were frequently referred to as “pansies” or “buttercups,”</mark> and certain flowers, such as green carnations, had been secret symbols of one’s sexual interests since the days of Oscar Wilde.

<mark>Interestingly the short never seems to suggest that Ferdinand is somehow depraved or deserving of contempt for his desires. Although his mother wants to know why he doesn't want to run and leap and butt heads like the other young bulls, she accepts her son's lifestyle without much second thought.

Somerton reuses a section of the book where Griffin quotes gay journalist and activist Jack Babuscio who passed away of AIDS in 1990. Griffin explains who he is and discusses his quote, mentioning by name repeatedly. You know, the way you quote someone and discuss what they said.

13. Disney cynically exploited Howard Ashman's death

Okay, the best source I could find about Disney's relationship with Howard Ashman was the book *Disney War* and here's what it says: 

<span id="ashman_exploited"><mark></mark>First, about Howard Ashman's open gayness being a problem for Disney, the book points in the opposite direction. It says that when Disney recruited Ashman, he asked them if his sexuality was gonna be an issue, and he was assured that it would not be. And when he later revealed his AIDS diagnosis to Eisner and Katzenberg and animation head Peter Schneider, they were all very supportive.</span> 

<span id="aid_for_aids"><mark></mark>Second, this supposed donation to the AID for AIDS Foundation, there's just nothing. I've looked and looked and found no connection between Disney and this charity, or any other shocking revelations about their Oscar campaign. There's just *no* publicity for this supposed publicity stunt. Disney *did* make a charity album for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation in 1991, but uh, it had no connection to the Oscars. They auctioned off some *Beauty in the Beast* art for the Gay Men's Health Crisis in 1992, but that would have been *after* the Oscars. The only connection I could find between Disney and AID for AIDS was the Disney Gay Night event I mentioned previously. And again, that was *not* connected to the Disney corporation.</span>

<span id="ashman_award"><mark></mark>And as for them being upset about Ashman's partner accepting his Oscar, according to *Disney War* Katzenberg arranged that *personally*. If any other executives felt differently about it, *please* tell me where you found this information. But I don't understand why they'd make pandering donations to gays and then not be okay with a gay man on stage. Are they pandering to gays or not?</span>

James' own source, *Tinker Belles and Evil Queens*, provides additional evidence for the fact that Ashman was well-supported, at least by Katzenberg. It mentions that Katzenberg and Ashman had a close relationship several times (108, 192), and Katzenberg is said to have been involved with AIDS charities (110). Katzenberg called Ashman a "guardian angel" alongside Walt Disney, and there was a tribute to Ashman at the end of *Beauty and the Beast* (144). Also, [a Washington Post article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220422110450/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/22/lbgtq-audiences-artists-helped-save-disney/) claims that Disney even built a production unit near his house so that he could keep getting his treatments nearby.

Disney's animosity toward the queer community wasn't just all behind the scenes, though. It still managed to make it onto the big screen, beginning immediately with the first film of the Disney Renaissance, *The Little Mermaid*. 

The film's source material was obviously written by noted gay writer Hans Christian Anderson, so there's an immediate queer reading of the text available, but Disney went further than that by carrying on their tradition of having an older female villain who is predatory toward a young girl. But to add a special twist, Ursula was actually modeled after drag legend Divine. Though despite rumors, Disney never entertained the thought of offering the part to Divine and always intended on casting a female voice talent. Recent calls for the live action Ursula to be played by a drag queen were roundly ignored.

Disney also never intended Ursula to sing in the film.<sup cn></sup> <mark>But Howard Ashman thought otherwise, forcing<sup cn></sup> Disney to accept the now iconic villain song "Poor Unfortunate Souls." In the number, Ursula uses various methods to convince Ariel to sell her soul, from looking sorry and saintlike to shimmying madly in excitement.</mark> <mark v>In its use of vocalist Pat Carroll's ability to slide up and down the musical register, from shrieks to baritones, "Poor Unfortunate Souls" is an unmistakable sendup of the campy female impersonation numbers</mark> of underground queer films in the early days of Hollywood.

<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.tinker_belles at="p.146-147"%}>

Again, how much of this is due to Ashman needs to be placed in context with others working on the films. For example, Andreas Deja obviously did his share in adding to the camp value of these projects. Ashman himself probably had little say in the model sheet for Ursula. Yet, her campy nature is due at least in part to the words that Ashman gives her to perform. In *The Little Mermaid*, <mark>Ashman provided Ursula with a solo number, “Poor Unfortunate Souls.”<sup>37</sup> In the number, Ursula uses various methods to convince Ariel the mermaid to sell her soul — from looking penitent and saintlike to shimmying madly in excitement.</mark> <mark stat:id="m-context">“In its use of vocalist Pat Carroll’s ability to slide up and down the musical register, from shrieks to baritones, ‘Poor Unfortunate Souls’ is an unmistakable sendup of the campy female impersonation number.”</mark><sup>38</sup> Similarly, although Deja must share credit, Ashman not only helped conceive Gaston in *Beauty and the Beast* but emphasizes his campiness through the lyrics of *his* solo number, “Gaston,” a hysterical “*male* impersonation” number! As was discussed in chapter 2, the tradition of reading Disney villains as “gay-tinged” reaches much farther back than Ashman’s involvement with the studio. Ashman’s creation of musical numbers for the villains, though, underlines this position, allowing mainstream audiences and reviewers to positively revel in the campiness of their villainy.

I was shocked to learn that a queer reading of *Beauty and the Beast* was actually pretty well documented in popular culture at the time of its release.

The source video's closed captioning is screwy "Broadcast Quality" CC, which means its bad and 30 seconds late, and so didn't ping on Filmot when I was trying to search for this clip.

27. Dying AIDS patients kept a "Beauty and the Beast" rose by their beds

(God, this one video in particular man, I--) Anyway, the source for this fact is... <u>[Close-up of the "Source?" "I made it up" meme]</u> you know, who knows, question mark. I'm inclined to disbelieve it just because... just, I mean just because it's so ghoulish and horrible to keep a symbolic ticking death clock by your bed. Are, are you sure you're not thinking of just like, regular flowers that you give to hospital patients? Again, this is one of the segments that's largely sourced from *Tinker Belles*, everything he says about *Beauty and the Beast* AIDS subtext is from that book except this detail.

PWAs “poached” from Disney texts long before *Beauty and the Beast*. <mark>Lesbian and gay employees of the theme parks remark on how many of their AIDS-infected friends desire to visit Disneyland and Walt Disney World,</mark> specifically seeing their trips as a way of dealing with their status. <mark>Also, many AIDS quilt panels include Disney imagery — mouse ears, Disney song lyrics and the like. Some panels commemorate Disney employees, but some pay tribute to a fan’s devotion to the studio’s products.</mark> While wrong to conceive that every Disney-influenced panel *must* refer to a homosexual (thus implying that AIDS is only a homosexual disease), certain panels make the sexual orientation of the remembered person quite clear. For example, one particularly colorful panel commemorating an adult male depicts an underwater scene and contains a number of lines from songs written for *The Little Mermaid* (1989), the animated musical Disney made just before *Beauty and the Beast*. Amongst these are such quotes as “The men up there don’t like a lot of blather,” and “Don’t forget the importance of body language.” The attention paid by television and print news to the displays of the AIDS Quilt might have made some, like Rather, more aware of the importance of Disney in these people’s lives, thus making it easier to understand the 1991 film as an AIDS allegory.

<mark num=2></mark>Oh my God, James, no. *First* of all, the song was not written *for* Aladdin's mother to sing; Sean Griffin is wrong on this account. It was written for Aladdin to sing *to* his mother, expressing his low self-worth, of not being good enough, wishing that she could be proud of him. That's why it's called "Proud of **Your** Boy", Aladdin is singing it to/about his mother.

Second, *James*, Disney did not cut it because the song was "not subtle" w.r.t. homosexuality. (The fact that the song has been co-opted by the *very straight* [Proud Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys) attests to that fact.) In fact, Disney and Ashman's collaborators [*loved* the song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_of_Your_Boy#Background), but the writing process eventually eliminated the mother as a character, and thus the song of its narrative relevance. (It was effectively replaced by the One Jump reprise.)

In Disney's next animated feature, we wouldn't get a sea drag queen, an AIDS allegory, or a campy Genie. Instead, we got accidental gay parents and yet another queer coded villain. But before then, Disney accidentally produced an iconic entry into the queer cinematic canon with *Hocus Pocus*. No gay coding here, though I always hoped Thackery Binks was gay, just three campy witches that would go on to inspire generations upon generations of drag queens.

Though we may not remember it, *The Lion King* was pretty controversial upon release. Disney's return to the main stage of animation in the early 90s with *The Little Mermaid* had pissed off a *lot* of feminists, who were aghast that Disney made a movie in which the female lead *literally* has her voice stolen from her. 

<mark>To fix this, they made Belle a very proactive, intelligent character in *Beauty and the Beast*.</mark> Then they received a huge amount of backlash from Arab Americans after the release of *Aladdin* for some... 

<u>[On screen, lyrics to "Arabian Nights" are shown: "Where they cut off your ear / If they don't like your face / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."]</u>

<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

This is, roughly, a paraphrase of p.207-210 of Griffin, combined with general pop culture knowledge. Some additional context: Disney actually hired a woman screenwriter, Linda Woolverton, for *Beauty and the Beast*, (likely) in response to the feminist critiques of *The Little Mermaid* (143, 207, 210), rising from Ariel's dependence on male characters (the book does not mention this commonly-cited "pop culture" feminist critique regarding Ariel's voice.) Still, he notes, 

> "The variety of reaction from women when the film was released points out that many of the problems women found in *The Little Mermaid* were not solved. Consequently, while many gay men responded warmly to Beauty and the Beast, many lesbians might have had a hard time finding anything they could take from a film in which the female lead’s only duty is to choose whether she will marry an egotistical macho jerk or a male behemoth." (pp207-208) 

As for the criticisms by Arab Americans, I didn't see a criticism of the voice cast mentioned in the book, and the lyric criticisms were part of a larger criticism of how Arab culture is portrayed in *Aladdin* (which is to say, in a very sterotypical, orientalist way that does not at all match reality.)

Also, the two seem to enjoy dressing up in various types of drag throughout the run of the series.<sup>76</sup>

Disney’s relationship with the gay community often mirrors this pattern. Deja, in his studio-sanctioned interviews, makes certain to assert that the work of the homoerotic artist Tom of Finland had no inﬂuence on his drawing of *Beauty and the Beast*’s beefy Gaston.48 In the interviews with Deja conducted just before the release of *Aladdin*, he is questioned about some of the jokes in the ﬁlm, such as the “Genie-as-prissy-tailor” scene. When told that such humor could easily be read as stereotypical and insensitive towards gays, Deja instead “gives an enthusiastic thumbs-up as a reply.”<sup>49</sup> This Disney-positive attitude is shared by Schumacher in his interview when the reporter for *The Advocate* questions him on “defecting to the enemy camp” by hiring renowned homophobe Mel Gibson as a voice for *Pocahontas*.<sup>50</sup> During a season when <mark>ABC</mark> was running low in the ratings, <mark>the Disney-owned network</mark> <mark v>used the coming-out episode of *Ellen* as a way to spike viewership during the May sweeps period.

While ABC and Disney trumpeted the “issue” of Ellen Morgan’s lesbianism to boost ratings and proﬁts, political statements were not welcome. Further, the network seemed to be antagonistic towards anyone else making a proﬁt off lesbianism with Ellen, since the network not only turned down an ad by the HRC but also one by Olivia Cruises, a vacation company aimed at lesbians. Both organizations eventually bought ad time with local afﬁliates in certain cities (Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, Phoenix, Detroit), but only viewers in these areas saw these TV spots.

5. Disney did a gay charity event and stole the profits.

Okay, this *is* a thing that happened, but it wasn't Disney. Disney Gay Days was an informal, unsanctioned event organized by an outside travel agency. They had *no* official connections to the actual park. It was discovered that the agency wasn't giving the profits to charity like they promised, and after that they went out of business. This had nothing to do with the actual Disney corporation.

The history of Gay Nights are detailed in Griffin's book as well. 

> "In the 1990s, the Odyssey Tours travel agency began renting out the park one night a year (usually during the early winter, traditionally a slow period for the park) to hold “Gay Nights” at the park. Although never specifically advertised with such a phrase, the flyers and print ads announced that portions of the proceeds would go to the Aid for AIDS charity, and, judging by the crowds these nights attracted, most people 'got the hint.' (p191) 

> "In 1995, the lesbian and gay circles of Southern California by and large turned away from the annual 'Gay Night' at Disneyland. While not a systemized boycott, word spread throughout the area that Odyssey Tours, who organized the event, was making only token donations of the proceeds to the Aid for AIDS charity — even though the publicity prominently described itself as a charity event. Conceiving of the 'Gay Night' as a 'con job' on lesbian and gay customers, attendance dropped precipitously." (p203) 

There were various boycots and other protests by Christian fundamentalists and the like from the mid 1990s onward, but none of them had to do with Gay Nights.

In 1997, Disney committed their first act of straight-washing with the release of *Hercules*. Based *very* loosely on the Greek myth of Heracles, the film overtly ignored the hero's well-known bisexuality (as well as his [uxoricidal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/uxoricide) mood swings) and once again codes the villain gay, this time making Hades, the Lord of the Underworld (one of the few Olympian gods *not* to have taken a male lover) into yet another mincing older man. Like Scar, with intentions of usurping the throne of power from his heteronormative brother.

[He did have heart surgery in 1994,](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/i-think-i-ve-got-a-real-problem-1078836.html), around the time Wells died and Katzenberg left the company, but that was well before *Pirates*.

In an interview after the film's release, Depp said, 

> "It trickled back to me that Michael Eisner went on some sort of bent about how 'Goddammit, Johnny Depp's ruining the film! What is that thing? Is it drunk, is it gay?' 

> 'What the f**k are you doing?' he'd asked. When they asked me if it- he was gay, I said: 'Didn't you know all my characters are gay?' I really expected to be fired but I wasn't for some reason."

This quote comes from the AFI Film Festival on November 8, 2015, [in a moderated conversation between Johnny Depp and *Black Pearl*'s director Scott Cooper](https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/afi-fest-johnny-depp-talks-black-mass-auditioning-for-the-coen-brothers-working-with-scott-cooper-more-106058/).

There's an audio recording of the interview, so I've transcribed the relevant section myself, in more exact detail. (around the 39 minute mark)

> "It trickled back to me that Michael Eisner went on some sort of bent about how "Goddammit, Johnny Depp's ruining the film! What is it? What is that thing? What, is it drunk? Is it gay?" And so I fully expected to be fired, and then I got a call from one of the upper echelon at Disney, who was courageous enough to ask me, "What the fuck are you doing?" And you know, again, the [unintelligible] words came up, "Is it drunk? Is it gay?" And all I could say was, 'cause it was just-- I was set up for a great line, so "Is it gay?" and I said "Didn't you know all my characters are gay?" I was really expecting to be fired, but they wouldn't for some reason. They were actually gonna subtitle my character. (Really? That's amazing!) Yeah, they couldn't understand Captain Jack."

The closest match to James' quote is [this article from the Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/johnny-depp-recalls-what-he-told-disney-bosses-confused-by-jack-sparrow-didn-t-you-know-all-my-characters-are-gay-a6728081.html), though he skips over the "upper echelon" part and attributes "What the fuck are you doing?" to Eisner.

> “It trickled back to me that [former CEO] Michael Eisner went on some sort of bent about how ‘Goddammit, Johnny Depp’s ruining the film! What is that thing? It is drunk, is it gay?’” he said, before recalling a meeting with “the upper echelon”.

> “What the f**k are you doing?” he was asked. “When they asked if it was gay, I said: ‘Didn’t you know all my characters are gay?’ I really expected to be fired but I wasn’t for some reason. They were actually gonna put subtitles under my character, they couldn’t understand Captain Jack.”

The film and its sequels went on to be big hits for the studio... for the most part. The new blood of 1980s Disney had all left the company by the time the *Pirates* sequels started coming out. Jeffrey Katzenberg left the company to start DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, Michael Eisner stepped down in a swirl of controversy, and Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash. In 2005, Bob Iger took over the position of CEO at Disney.

## Epilogue: A New Era?

<compare>
<james span=2 {% include timecode %}>

The company was under new management for the first time in twenty years. <mark fc=false>Iger was well known in political circles as a progressive on social issues and had spearheaded multiple initiatives while working under Michael Eisner to increase the rights of LGBT employees at Disney, and to empower LGBT Disney fans.</mark>

<mark fc=false>Under his stewardship Disney switched from the once-a-year Gay Night at Disney parks to the full Gay Days event, rebranding the occasion into a more family-friendly affair with the intention of helping bring LGBT families into the mainstream.</mark>

<mark fc=false>He was vocally opposed to George W. Bush's crusade to ban gay marriage and donated to the Obama for President campaign in 2008 under the caveat that Obama not defend the Defense of Marriage Act or "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" if he were to make it into office. Obama agreed, leading to both homophobic laws being overturned.</mark>

Queer Disney stans were excited for Iger's takeover of the company.<sup cn></sup> <mark fc=false>Having such a vocal supporter of LGBT rights</mark> as the head of a company like Disney could *only* mean good things. When Iger went on a spending spree buying up properties such as Marvel and Star Wars, gay fans got excited to see if queer characters would make their way into those franchises. As we know from the last video, they did not. <u>[record scratch]</u>

Now, obviously Iger couldn't rebrand something Disney wasn't doing and had no control over. Gay Days is actually a completely separate event which is also unofficial and unsanctioned by Disney. Also it started before Gay Night and 15 years before Iger became CEO. It's kind of impressive how wrong this was. He's giving fucking Disney credit for the actions of independent queer people. It really downplays the work that people put into organizing stuff like Gay Days. It's super disappointing, honestly. The first official Disney pride night happened this year [2023], three years after he made this video. *That's* how far off the mark he was on this.

18. Disney CEO Bob Iger has a strong pro-gay rights record

<span id="iger_fanfic1">Yeah I couldn't find any of that. If Iger ever did anything for gay Disney employees, I didn't find it. If Iger ever did anything for gay Disney fans, I didn't find it. Literally the only connection I could find between Iger and LGBT issues was that he was head of ABC when Ellen DeGeneres came out, which was under the Disney umbrella but not really Disney, you know? Any initiatives for gay Disney employees during the Eisner era happened before Iger ascended to the Disney corporation proper, so I don't think he was involved.</span>

<span id="iger_fanfic2">And I *know* Iger didn't redesign Gay Night into Disney Gay Days because, again, Gay Days was never a Disney sanctioned event. Disney didn't do a Pride event in America until this year, and for the record, it *was* a gay night. </span>

<span id="iger_fanfic3">And then [sighs] the stuff about opposing Bush's gay marriage ban, like... if a major executive at a family oriented American icon brand like Disney took a *bold* stance against the *president* on this *very* controversial issue, you'd think there'd be some coverage. But it just doesn't come up anywhere, not in searches, not in his memoir, not in 2017 when he was briefly floating a presidential run, he talked about climate change, gun violence, immigration, nothing about gay rights. If he had ever taken a stance *that* brave and ahead of the curve while running as a Democrat, it's political malpractice not to bring that up every chance you get. He has made some pro-gay rights statements more recently, but that was after he left the company and *well* after Somerton's video came out. </span>

<span id="iger_fanfic4">And okay, all that stuff about Obama. Uh, you can see people's donations, so I went to opensecrets.org, which does have a listing for all of Iger's donations. Uh, it doesn't list any donations to Obama in '08, and uh, none of the committees Iger donated to gave to Obama either, I think because Obama was not accepting any corporate PAC money that election.</span>

Iger has been a benign CEO as far as LGBT representation goes. While he hasn't allowed *major* characters to come out as LGBT, <mark fc num=1>putting his foot down when Taiko Watiti planned for Valkyrie to be a lesbian in *Thor: Ragnarok*,</mark> he has allowed smaller queer characters to appear, <mark fc num=2>such as the lodge owners in *Frozen*</mark>, LeFou in the *Beauty and the Beast* remake, Specter in *Onward*, and a quick lesbian kiss in *Star Wars: Episode IX.* 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter video=todd at="2772" %}>

And one minor bonus claim: on the other hand, Iger wouldn't let Valkyrie be gay in *Thor: Ragnarok*. 

Okay, fact check, according to *Rolling Stone* they *did* shoot a scene confirming that Valkyrie *was* gay, but it was cut for pacing reasons. That's the official story, at least. You don't have to believe it, but there's no actual reporting saying that it was cut for any other reason or that Iger was the one that made that call. That's just speculation and I don't think you should present it as fact.

One *could* argue that he could have been vetoing all LGBT representation like Disney CEOs before him, that he could be actively opposing us... but I say that's a pretty pathetically low bar. 

Disney is the preeminent media provider right now, with *Pixar*, *Star Wars*, *Marvel*, *Fox*, and their own original properties, it could be argued that they're growing a media monopoly. One I've contributed to myself. I was one of the people arguing for Disney to buy up Fox so that we could finally get some good X-Men and Fantastic 4 movies that weren't [*Logan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_(film)). Also that they buy up Sony Pictures so that Spider-Man can stay in the MCU.

But now that Disney *does* own Fox, I have to wonder, when they make their X-Men movie, will Iceman be straight again? He came out of the closet in the comics a few years ago with a really touching storyline. Will Disney do away with that for a liveaction Iceman? Or will they simply... keep him on the bench so they don't have to deal with it at all?

Now that Disney owns *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, what will become of that? Will it continue to run as a midnight movie event, or will Disney pull the film prints that are in circulation? They're certainly controlling over their copyrighted content, so I can imagine they wouldn't be too pleased with theaters showing the film without their say so.

An odd ray of hope in Disney, then, is Kevin Feige, the mastermind behind the MCU. He's threatened to quit before, not over pay raises, but over control of characters. Disney gave in to his demands, <mark fc=false>and only *once* has stepped into to override his decision, that being Valkyrie's queerness.</mark> Even with their attempted straight-washing, the coding is still... so *obvious* it can barely be called coding. 

His contract is once again coming up for renewal, and it looks like Valkyrie will indeed be looking for her queen in *Thor: Love and Thunder*. <mark yikes stat:id="y-biphobia">A lesbian lead character</mark> in a potentially billion dollar movie will make Disney execs quake in their Gucci loafers, but worrying over that might be worth keeping the Golden Goose that is Kevin Feige.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

As far as I can tell, Kevin Feige didn't have anything to do with the Valkyrie thing, again, that was just cut for pacing. Also, again, she's bisexual, this is a pretty well known fact.

The Young Avengers featuring Marvel's premier gay couple, Wiccan and Hulkling, is reportedly in development, either as a Disney Plus show or as a feature film. Hulkling being the king of space and Wiccan being the center point for all existence in the Marvel universe makes them pretty much the *ultimate* superhero power couple. 

And Brie Larsson has been very blunt in her opinion the Captain Marvel should have a girlfriend in her sequel<sup cn></sup>, while Tom Holland will use any opportunity to let reporters know that he thinks his Spider-Man needs a boyfriend.

So is it possible for Disney, via Marvel Studios, to become the main source for LGBT representation in Hollywood, all because of one producer they're terrified to lose? It's a distinct possibility. 

Though the gay representation in *Avengers: Endgame* was much maligned by LGBT audiences, it was an interesting experiment. <mark fc=false>The scene is small and easily removable, but Marvel refused to cut it for the film's release in countries like China, Russia, and... places in the Middle East, calling the bluff of those countries' censorship guidelines. And since theater owners didn't want to lose out on a Marvel movie, the scene stayed in.</mark> Effectively, a positive test run to see if Feige and Marvel could indeed get away with having queer characters in Marvel movies, even in countries where homosexuality may be punishable by death.

</james>
<comment id="marvel_gay_scene" {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

I found no evidence that Marvel "refused to cut" the scene in other countries. [One article about Russia claims that the scene was dubbed in a way that hid the romantic implications of the dialogue](https://meduza.io/en/shapito/2019/04/30/russia-s-dubbed-version-of-avengers-endgame-changes-marvel-s-first-gay-moment) [Also, apparently Disney refused to screen the English version of the film (with subtitles) in Russia](https://www.change.org/p/walt-disney-studios-motion-pictures-avengers-endgame-%D0%B2-%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8-in-russia-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%81-%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8-we-demand-subtitle) for some reason. I couldn't find anything about China or "places in the Middle East" that supports or refutes James' argument.

But Marvel is the outlier at Disney. No producer at Disney has the power and influence that Kevin Feige does, and even *he* hasn't managed to have an out queer main character in a film yet, though we're apparently getting one with *The Eternals*, if that ever gets released. 

The House of Mouse continues, though, to profit from its LGBT fan base while starving us for representation, so that we'll be satisfied by the scraps they see fit to toss us. A queer ascended extra, or a blink-and-you miss-it moment does not make up for everything Disney has done.

It's a well-known fact among industry professionals that Mulan was altered *so* drastically from its original animated form *specifically* to appeal to the Chinese box office, which is *why* any hint at bi or trans representation has been removed from the film, even the coding, at least according to the people I know who have seen the movie.<sup cn>who</sup> <mark fc=false>And their *Jungle Cruise* movie has an implied gay character that the test audiences found *so* offensive that the movie saw *massive* delays in order to re-shoot *giant* sections of the film.</mark>

<comment id="jungle_cruise" {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

*Jungle Cruise* did have reshoots (in spring 2019), and people did complain a lot about the initial reporting and trailers in regards to the gay character (for being played by a straight man, being described as "camp", and reports that the word "gay" wouldn't actually be used), but "they reshot the film because they made an offensive gay stereotypes" [seems to just be a Twitter rumor/speculation based on his lack of dialogue in the first trailer](https://www.themarysue.com/mcgregor-houghton-gay-character-disney-jungle-cruise/) that got spread as fact. The movie was delayed ([in October 2018, the release was pushed back from October 2019 to July 2020](https://www.slashfilm.com/561805/jungle-cruise-release-date/), and then later pushed back another year because of COVID), but there's no indication of why.

At the Disney parks, it's not uncommon to see rainbow-laced Disney shirts, hats, Mickey ears, pins, bracelets, and notebooks, all kinds of merchandise. They are *more than willing* to sell us all sorts of stuff, except a ticket to a movie with actual representation.

They will happily take our money and slyly wink when we ask if Elsa is a lesbian. They'll sell us a movie ticket and shrug "Who knows?" when we ask if Poe and Finn will kiss. They'll sign you up for a year's membership to Disney Plus, and then move *Love, Victor* to Hulu.

Disney is a company like any other: they go where the profits are, and they are drawn to those profits like a shark to blood. The thing is, the LGBT community has been feeding them with no demand for something in return. 

They queerbait Stucky, Finnpoe, and Elsa. We still give them our money. 

They make a huge deal out of an "exclusively gay moment," just to give us two seconds of two men dancing. And we still give them our money. 

They remove even the gay coding from their remakes. And we still give them our money.

Is Disney the worst company in the world? No, of course not, it's not like they're fracking when people leave the parks. 

I've loved Disney for as long as I can remember. The first movie I saw in theaters was *Aladdin*. My first crushes were Aladdin and Hercules. I knew for sure that I was 100% gay because I saw Tarzan swinging around half naked and thought, "yep, that's what I want." 

Disney isn't Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby, it's not a hateful company. And it's not a company most people can *easily* drop from their lives, Disney is a part of the culture now. Hell, they've created a big chunk of the culture that we live in.

So I'm not saying you need to stop seeing Disney movies, but I do think we need to send Disney a very strong message. Either give us representation or don't. Stop the baiting. Stop the "maybe"'s and the "who knows?" and the "someday"'s. And stop promising us representation and then taking it away.

This video began as a quick angry rant after Disney tried blocking my last video from going up. But it evolved into something else entirely. I started looking into the history of queerness in Disney movies and found a lot more than I was expecting. 

And I shouldn't be surprised, because of course it's there! There's queerness everywhere because *we* are everywhere. We're storytellers and artists, craftsmen and animators, composers, lyricists, executives and producers. We help run the Disney parks, and we're in costume at those parks. So of course we've found our way into the history of Disney. As employees and fans, we represent Disney *every single day*... 

And it's about damn time Disney starts representing us.

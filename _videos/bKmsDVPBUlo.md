Hey everyone.

A few weeks ago, I announced the formation of Telos Pictures, a production company dedicated to producing LGBTQ films and series for an LGBTQ audience. Our *wildest hope* was to raise six-thousand dollar to produce two short films to use as a proof-of-concept to try and raise further money down the road for more expansive productions.

As of March 11th, we have raised... and I'm kind of shocked to be able to say this... 

<u>[Shows IndieGoGo bar: $41,541 CAD raised from 474 backers; 692% of $6,000 Flexible Goal, with 31 days left.]</u>

...almost seven-hundred percent of that goal. To everyone who has donated, whether it be a dollar or thousands of dollars, I *cannot* thank you enough.

Growing up as a gay kid who wanted to make movies where I could see people like me? Witnessing this immense outpouring of support has been *mind-blowing!* Truly! From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. It's thanks to your generosity that Telos will not only be able to produce short films, but go even further.

We're already in pre-production on *two* short films: 

<u>[On Screen]: "The Final Girl" (with shiny knife behind it)</u>

"The Final Girl", a look at what happens to the lone survivor of a slasher movie-style serial killer, once the killer has been caught and the fame goes away.

And, a modern-day adaptation of John Polidori's *The Vampyre*, about a newly-out gay man who becomes enthralled by a charismatic and youthful creature of the night.

<james {% include timecode %}>

And we're *very* excited to say that, thanks to your generosity, we've been able to expand the budgets of these shorts, so that everyone working on them can be paid fairly. No working for experience, and no calling in favors. The artists in front of and behind the camera will be paid what they really deserve. 

And, we're not stopping there. We're also on pre-production on a *series* entitled "She Comes at Night", the story of a lesbian who survives the brutal gay-bashing of her queer friend group, and seeks revenge when the gay panic defense leads to the killers being let off with a slap on the wrist. Think "promising young woman meets John Wick".

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But we want to go even further. We have several feature films planned that will not only star gay, lesbian, and *bisexual* characters, but transgender, non-binary, and asexual characters as well. And we don't mean witty supporting characters who pop in for a scene or two. *Actual. Lead. Characters.*

I've also been busy talking to LGBTQ artists from around the world who wanna help out on these projects. Sound designers. Concept artists. Visual effects artists. And composers. So we're putting together a team of ***super*** talented queer artists that will help bring Telos Pictures films and series to you in the highest quality-form possible.

<james {% include timecode %}>

<span stat:id="irony" id="if-you-got-money">Now, I cannot possibly ask for more donations from the people who have already given to Telos. All of you have gone *above* and beyond anything I *ever* expected. (Although, if you're lucky enough to have some money burning a hole in your pocket, by all means.)</span>

So I just wanted to ask to share this video if you can. To let more people know about Telos: our mission, our determination, and our goals. Every donation means more stories can be told, more queer artists can be employed, and *hopefully* show those most at risk in our community that they are not alone. And that there *are* people who want to help tell their stories to the world. 

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've also added a very *special* new tier: the Angel Investor Tier. This is for someone with *way* too much money on their hands, but wants to see a specific type of queer story told. You get all the perks of the Telos founder tier, plus you get to pitch and idea to Telos that we'll figure out how to make happen. The link to the IndieGoGo campaign is in the description of this video, where you can also ask me *any* questions that you might have about Telos Pictures. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tustin %}>

The "Angel Investor" tier is $3,000 Canadian. Before this, the highest tier was "Executive Producer" at $1,000 Canadian, which is the tier [the Ace Couple paid for](https://theacecouple.com/episode116/).

So again, thank you so much for everything you've done for us. A month ago, Telos was a dream of an idea. Now it's real, and becoming stronger and clearer every single day. Something that's given *me*  hope at a time that so many politicians are trying to erase us. And that hope is all because of you! Thank you... *all*... so much, *truly, honestly*, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much!

Now let's go to the movies.

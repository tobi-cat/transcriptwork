All of you have gone *above* and beyond anything I *ever* expected. (Although, if you're lucky enough to have some money burning a hole in your pocket, by all means.)"}

  - {source: UiDcQnavKPI, id: respect-identities, quote: "But if we — gay men, women, lesbians, trans writers, and even straight men — are going to exist in a community of writers and content creators without gatekeepers, we need to be able to recognize how certain identities would like to be *respected*."}
  - {source: UiDcQnavKPI, id: am_i_being_disingenuous, quote: "\n\nEspecially that, if we’re gonna get philosophical, people are rarely honest with themselves. *I’m* making a monetized video about how it’s bad that corporations are using queerness to sell a product without actually either promoting queer identity, or promoting queer creations. Is there really a way to objectively say that *I’m* not just making this video for the money? Other than the fact that my YouTube ad revenue is NOT impressive. But there’s no way for you, the audience, to verify if I’m being disingenuous or not. If I’m *baiting* you anymore or any less than these producers I’ve been ranting about.\n\nI’ve spent the last two years on here, on literally every live stream, talking about how my dream is to make movies and series about queer characters that aren’t JUST about being queer. A way to give back to the community, create movies and series, the likes of which *I never got to see* growing up. Hell, I still don’t get to see them much. But I haven’t actually gone ahead and done that, now have I? You can assume I will actually give back to the community, create works for the community that go above and beyond youtube. But will I? \n\n"}

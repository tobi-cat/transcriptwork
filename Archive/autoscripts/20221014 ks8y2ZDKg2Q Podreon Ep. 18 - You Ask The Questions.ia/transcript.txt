00:00:00:05 - 00:00:29:11
James
Hello everyone, and welcome to episode 18 of the Adrian. It's just me again. Um, I think there's going to be this one and another episode, and then we'll have some episodes with Nick again. I think I might be wrong. I might be completely wrong. Who knows? Also very sorry for getting this episode out so late. I try to get the padre ons out every Tuesday, which I have failed at miserably in most cases.

00:00:31:33 - 00:00:56:49
James
But this week I thought that I was getting better. I had been sick for a while. I thought I was getting better. And then I hit a wall again, which was just lovely. Um, but I did a stream last night, so I'm recording this on Thursday. I did a stream on Wednesday where I started to get sick again.

00:00:56:49 - 00:01:35:16
James
And I am not feeling the best right now, but I'm like, I can't continue to put off the recording. So I took some Tylenol and I took some DayQuil and we'll see how long I last. So the concept behind this episode of the Patreon also I'm using a new microphone. It's a very expensive fancy microphone that I got specifically for streaming, but I'm using it for the Patreon as well.

00:01:36:30 - 00:02:04:03
James
At least on my end when when Nick gets back will be using the normal microphones. But um, yeah. So hopefully it, it sounds good. But yeah. So the crux of this episode of the Padron is I put out a message to everyone who is a patron sort of asking you guys if there are any questions that you would really like answered.

00:02:04:03 - 00:02:25:53
James
Kind of no holds barred and anything that you would like me to answer in kind of a long winded way, like a very detailed answer is something that if we were doing an AMA that was just a stream, you know, I'd be kind of trying to get through questions because there's usually like 50 questions or something like that.

00:02:26:11 - 00:02:50:00
James
And so I'm usually trying to get through them and not being able to give like really detailed answers. And I've looked at some of the questions that came in, and unfortunately from some of them, I'm not going to be able to give detailed answers just because I'm not as knowledgeable about things as I should be. Maybe. But yeah, so let's start.

00:02:50:00 - 00:03:32:49
James
I won't say like which Who asked which question? Um, it's not a, you know, keeping people private thing. It's a I'm going to run into names I can't pronounce and I don't want to look dumb. So that's why. So I'm just going to go in order of who asks the questions first. So first question is what sort of movies shows and other media would you recommend to a mid-twenties by a man who hasn't really gotten the chance to experience much queer media due to a sheltered upbringing, sort of a required viewing list or your top picks?

00:03:33:14 - 00:04:23:54
James
Um, the sad part is that specifically for representation of bisexual men, there's next to none. Um, there there's a bit more representation for bisexual women, but for bisexual men it's just kind of like non-existent because people still very much have, you know, this, this mindset that if a character is bisexual, they're only bisexual until like, if a guy, if a male character is bisexual, he's only bisexual until he gets a girlfriend or hooked up with a girl, then he's straight and then, you know, if he doesn't hook up with another guy, if he doesn't get a boyfriend or something like that, then he's just straight, Oh, he was in a phase.

00:04:23:54 - 00:05:00:23
James
He's straight now, which is incredible. Infuriating. Um, as a gay person who, you know, is always interested in male male relationships in media, whether they be gay or bisexual, that kind of write off. And this is this comes from a lot of this isn't just like straight people doing the writing off. This is gay people, too. Gay people are just as horrid as straight people in this account where a lot of gay people kind of look at bisexual people, especially bisexual men, and they're like, hmm, so you're like the dick, but you want to go home to a wifey.

00:05:00:36 - 00:05:29:31
James
And it's like, Oh my God, guys. So with that little tirade out of the way, um, I can't really think of a whole lot as I type away. I can't really think of a whole lot of movies or TV shows with a lot of bisexual representation. Oh, God, Netflix is making noise. Um, yeah, obviously I should not be doing these alone.

00:05:29:31 - 00:06:09:57
James
I'm horrible at this, but, uh. Um. Yeah. I can't really think of a whole lot of movies or TV shows that specifically have male bisexual representation. Um, I can think of ones that have, you know, like male gay representation. I mean, there's heart stopper, of course, which Nick is a not Nick, my production partner. But Nick in the show is bisexual and actually has like a really sweet coming out storyline there.

00:06:10:24 - 00:06:39:19
James
Um, there was a Netflix movie that came out a while ago. I'm blanking on the name of it now. I'm trying to hunt it down here. Um, and I'm sure so many of you are listening right now and you're just kind of like screaming it out into the void because you're like, I know what he's talking about. Um.

00:06:40:33 - 00:07:11:15
James
Oh, my God. This is. This is so frustrating. Why is a Caitlyn Jenner documentary being recommended to me? Alex Strangelove. Um, if I remember correctly, Alex Strangelove is a teenager who is coming to terms with his bisexuality, and that's honestly the only movie I can think of with any male bisexual representation. Um, there's a bit more on TV shows.

00:07:11:54 - 00:07:47:29
James
Um, if you watch like American Horror Story, bisexual guys have popped up on different seasons of that, um, but a lot of times it's, it's kind of, I find when there's a bisexual male character, it's very lip service. He um, for instance David from Schitt's Creek is I can't remember if he identifies as bisexual or pansexual. Um, but he is not, you know, like 100% gay.

00:07:47:58 - 00:08:28:21
James
But we only really see him in relationships in the show with dudes. And that's kind of how I find a lot of bisexual rep for male characters goes is that it's you know like I said they're they're basically gay with an Asterix asterisk. Asterix as an asterisk. Um, which is really disappointing. Um, you know, I can recommend like gay stuff up and down, which I'm actually thinking about doing a, I did the video that was breaking down, you know, the quote unquote best gay movies.

00:08:28:21 - 00:09:04:19
James
I'm actually thinking about doing one. That's just actually my own opinion and not just taking, um, movies from lists that had been pre ordained as the best gay movies. Um, so looking for that one. But, um, Alex Strangelove is a cute movie and heart stopper obviously is like painfully adorable. Um, there's a lot of Y.A. books with bisexual male characters, and I'm feeling like a dumb ass now because I can't remember them.

00:09:04:35 - 00:09:36:55
James
I maybe should have prepared for this. And I'm really sorry. I don't know if this pop filter works or how I'm this new microphone is. It's weird and it's all metal and stuff anyway. But yeah, I there's I probably should have prepared for this instead of just going in and reading the questions and giving my, uh, unfiltered answers, which by the looks of things were good, be long answers, long rambling answers of nothing.

00:09:37:28 - 00:10:08:51
James
Um, yeah. Unfortunately other than Alex Strangelove and hurt stop stopper even with heart stopper. I mean, we don't see Nick with a girl really. And I don't think we're going to I mean, we don't really in the comics so you know how ever that ends up but unfortunately there's not a lot of good bisexual representation for men, not a whole lot of good bisexual representation for women either.

00:10:09:16 - 00:10:38:04
James
Um, which is, you know, a problem that ought to be rectified. Um, but yeah, I'm sorry that I couldn't give you a better answer there, but there's two examples you've probably already seen. Heart stopper in all likelihood. Um, if you're just kind of looking for gay good gay movies, there is the video that I have a ranking the quote unquote best queer movies ever made.

00:10:38:29 - 00:11:05:58
James
Um, and that's a, that's a pretty safe, safe space, too. Safe space, safe place to go to find some good recommendations for stuff. And I'm sorry that I was not more prepared for that question. Um, so the next question is interview with the vampire has got me wondering what some of your favorite vampire media is, queer or otherwise.

00:11:06:25 - 00:11:29:54
James
I say, like all vampires are a little queer, primarily interested in movies and shows, but I would love to hear what books and even games and other media you might pick. Well, I think the current TV show of Interview with the Vampire is currently my favorite vampire thing. Like, as far as movies and TV shows go, like is completely exceeding my expectations.

00:11:31:58 - 00:12:17:56
James
Bram Stoker's Dracula, the 1992 movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. That is a phenomenal movie. It's a bit messy. Um, in that, you know, Keanu Reeves had not quite figured out how to act yet. Um, and, but it is just, it's, it's a horror peak horror camp and it's wonderful. Um, and then we've got, you know, the original Nosferatu with Count Orlok, which I love because it's a, it's, you know, it's not doing the handsome vampire shtick, which really rose up with Bela Lugosi's Dracula in 1933.

00:12:17:58 - 00:12:39:43
James
I want to say these are 1933 or 1930 or every one of those years in between. Um, I'm pretty sure it's 33, but, uh, and true blood. I know true blood has kind of like fallen people. A lot of people, if you like, don't talk. They don't remember True Blood at this point because it did kind of go off the rails near the end.

00:12:40:13 - 00:13:09:46
James
But those first couple of seasons are really good. Like, I loved them unironically, like as it got later on and we started dealing with the fey and and where Panthers and stuff like that. It got a little bit hokey, but it was still fun. Still fun to watch. Um, and True Blood was took a lot of inspiration from, you know, and Rice's vampires in that they're basically all bisexual.

00:13:10:22 - 00:13:42:18
James
Um so if you want some good but you know again if you want some good male bisexual rep, watch some vampire stuff because you know, and Rice's vampires and the and true blood you got a lot of bisexual vampires there. Um books wise Salem's Lot by Stephen King I think is a really good vampire story. It's one of the rare vampire stories that have come out recently that's actually a horror story and not just not romanticizing the vampire.

00:13:42:45 - 00:14:24:28
James
Um, and the Simon Snow books, which aren't really vampire books, but, um, it's kind of well, it literally started out as Harry Potter fan fiction and the Draco analogy, um, or analog is a vampire. He was made into a vampire and there's a lot of vampire characters in there. And so I really like those. I talked about that on the most recent stream, um, and how I think there really ought to be more than three books because I feel like three books is really cheating the audience out of what could be a fantastic ongoing series.

00:14:24:59 - 00:14:58:21
James
Every book series that I like, I feel should be like Discworld. It should just go on and on and on and on and on and on. Unending just never end. Never let the author write anything different. Just continue with the last sorry, had to drink water. The next question. I was really happy when I saw you were planning on talking about my favorite anime revolutionary grow tenor, and that got me wondering if you've heard of scene cool he Niko he who are there other two gay anime.

00:14:59:34 - 00:15:18:05
James
Your thoughts on them would really be interesting to hear as they're layered in symbolism. I have not heard of them and I'm assuming that name I couldn't pronounce is the either producer or Mangaka behind Revolutionary girl looked at revolutionary girl who tenor. Oh, that's going to be difficult to say. Like a thousand times when I do the video.

00:15:20:18 - 00:15:44:06
James
But no, I haven't checked out any of their other stuff, but I will check it out for the video. I will look into that because I would like the video to be as comprehensive as possible. So I will definitely look into that. The next question is sorry if you've answered this before, but do you think you'll make or use a letterboxd account?

00:15:44:47 - 00:16:23:25
James
I actually do have a letterboxd account. Um, I think let's see if I have a letterboxd account. I'm pretty sure I do sign and I do. I knew I had one. I just haven't been using it like, ever. Yeah, I have an account, but like, where are my movies? He has an ad for a camera accessory that I really want, but I shouldn't buy because it's $1,000.

00:16:27:52 - 00:17:06:23
James
Okay. Yeah. This looks like I might have done a list. Um, so obviously I'm not very good at Letterboxd. Um, even though I have one, I wonder I can. I'll put the link to my profile. I'm sure there's a way I can do that. Probably with that button. No, not that, but I'll figure that out. I'll put it in the description of of this podcast so that you can follow me, I guess.

00:17:06:23 - 00:17:42:54
James
And once I actually kind of get the hang of it. Oh, yeah. Okay. Now I see all the, all of them, all of my like rankings on here are really high because I don't I feel bad giving things a bad ranking. Like my lowest one is three stars for Eraserhead, which a lot of film fans will like want to string me up for because and I also gave three and a half stars to The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, but five stars to scream.

00:17:43:35 - 00:18:11:42
James
So kind of tells you what my taste in movies are. But yeah, I do have a letter box and I should use it more because, you know, I'm kind of I guess I'm kind of a movie YouTuber. Um, I never really think of myself as one, but I think I'm a part of that space. Kind of, um, I should do more movie reviews on the new channel, which I'll also link down in the description.

00:18:12:07 - 00:18:44:36
James
Um, and maybe then I can kind of break into the movie, the film YouTube space with all of those people whose reviews I watch. Um, the next question has a reply. Oh, they second in this question. Okay, Um, so this question is I was wondering if, you know, the Montag siblings series of books by Mackenzie Li. The first one is called Gentleman's Guide Device and Virtue, which deals with sexual identity and society's expectations.

00:18:44:58 - 00:19:10:13
James
And if you did what you thought of it, I read Gentleman's Guide to Advice and Virtue, and absolutely I'd adored it. And when I heard that there was a sequel coming out, I was so excited. And then the sequel wasn't about their the the, the queer, the gay guys. It was about their sister. One of the one of them has a sister and it was about her.

00:19:10:57 - 00:19:43:42
James
And then the third book, I think is about a whole other character entirely. Um, and at the time there was a lot of female authors, um, writing gay books as their first book. And then when that became a huge hit, their second book would either be straight or it would be dealing with women in some way, whether they were straight women or lesbian or bisexual or what have you.

00:19:44:09 - 00:20:24:32
James
And I was irked that it seemed to me, anyway, that these authors knew that there was a huge fan base from both gay readers and a lot of girls and women reading them for gay male books, especially in the Y.A. sphere, and that they were breaking into it with that kind of book. And then once they got their audience wanting, once they got their success, they, you know, switched gears and went in a different direction and either went in a straight direction or, you know, lesbian direction, bisexual or what have you.

00:20:24:57 - 00:20:52:44
James
But they kind of left the gay male representation behind. And that irked me really badly at the time. Not so much now, but I've heard things about Mackenzie Lee as a person that kind of put me off that they a bit full of themselves. I might be completely wrong. They may be an amazing person. This was like book Twitter hearsay.

00:20:52:55 - 00:21:20:24
James
So don't take that as gospel, for God's sake. Um, but I also I think Mackenzie Lee also wrote a Loki book for Marvel, not a comic book, a novel about young Loki. And if I remember correctly, Loki does not do any queering, queer or rebel things in that book, which also put me off. Um, but yeah, I really liked the first book.

00:21:20:24 - 00:21:42:54
James
The first book was fantastic. I love those kind of swashbuckling adventure novels and having it be, you know, the adventurers, the gay guys was just right up my alley. So I loved that first book. And so if you like the the first book or if you check out the first book, you probably will like the the ones that follow.

00:21:43:12 - 00:22:13:10
James
I just have a a sour spot because I'm I'm bitter. More water. I'm out of water. You know, there's another bottle. Yeah. Next question is since one of your future videos will be about Bill, which ones have you watched and what are your favorites and why if you have one. Of course, that's a good question. I've watched a couple.

00:22:16:51 - 00:22:26:42
Speaker 2
Let's find the semantic error.

00:22:26:43 - 00:23:10:24
James
I watched that this year. That was really good. Um, I thought it was very kind of very cute and adorable. Um, your name engraved here in, um, you're on ice, obviously, but I love that you're on ice is counted as a a v l even though it's anime, a given is counted as a b l It's interesting. Um, C I've watched a couple, not as many as I I'm going to watch more before I do the video, obviously.

00:23:10:49 - 00:23:51:34
James
Um, but I've watched probably seven I want to say seven. Um, I think semantic error or semantic error was probably my favorite one that I've watched so far other than, you know, the anime ones like Give In and Jury on Ice and stuff like that. Um, yeah, I would say that Semantic error is my favorite one. Uh, it just kind of I liked the, the sort of the rivalry tension, the rivals, the lovers kind of thing.

00:23:52:13 - 00:24:33:46
James
Um, but I'll be diving headlong into that before I get into the video. The video is mostly going to be about the industry of Bell and how it's, you know, it exists in this weird, weird kind of zone that it's incredibly it's an incredibly successful genre of media in Asia. And it has made its way to the West and people who wouldn't otherwise be watching, you know, subtitled Media are watching it.

00:24:34:30 - 00:24:55:01
James
And Hollywood is just kind of like it's facing the other way going. What do you mean? What's all this noise behind me now? I can't turn around and look at it. What are you talking about? And it's so it's going to really be looking at the business side of things. But I will be highlighting a couple of Bell shows as well as some of the more problematic things in the genre.

00:24:55:28 - 00:25:29:27
James
Um, because some of them can be a bit violent, some of them can be very OC This one's the girl and you know, just kind of it's straight, but they filed off the serial numbers. Um, so yeah, it'll be an interesting video if, if I get to do it. Got to get those patron numbers up. Uh, next question is I believe you mentioned Neil Gaiman as a straight ally that writes surprisingly good LGBT+ characters, and that made me think.

00:25:29:27 - 00:25:52:01
James
Have you read Terry Pratchett and what do you think of his portrayal of LGBT plus narratives? I find that particularly interesting after Terfs tried to claim that Terry would agree with them, whereas his family and friends like Neil and many of his fans, me included, found that preposterous. Yeah, I haven't read that much Terry Pratchett stuff, but I watched a lot of interviews with him.

00:25:52:24 - 00:26:26:40
James
Um, followed a lot of other bit, followed a lot of his opinions in his later years. And um, the idea that he would be anything other than the most progressive and open minded just boggles my mind. Um, so like, so I haven't read a whole lot of his stuff. I've read a bit, a couple of things from Discworld, mostly the, the death novels and the, the witches.

00:26:27:09 - 00:26:53:42
James
Um, obviously Good Omens, which I'll be doing a video on later this year. Yes, November, I think. Um, which is perfect timing because they released the post, the new poster for Good Omens season two and the wings are in the shape of the heart. And I'm like, Oh my God, they're doing it. They're going there too. Yeah, but I'd like to read more of Terry Pratchett stuff.

00:26:53:54 - 00:27:45:00
James
I think he's very his his books are really funny and kind of lyrical. And I when I'm reading, I read things like they're thrillers and because his writing style doesn't match up with that, it's hard for me to sit down and read the book. So there's something that they're they're books that I think I would like to check out on, like Audible or something like that, because I really love his characters and the world that he built and everything but his writing style doesn't mesh with how I read, but would be perfectly fine with listening to a book that's that actually plays into like right now with House of the Dragon I bought, I own

00:27:45:00 - 00:28:10:13
James
The House is the House of the Dragon Book, but I only got about 30 pages into it, but I got through the audiobook in like two sittings of Minecraft. So sometimes, you know, depending upon the the writing style, A listening to the audiobook works a lot better for me, whereas sometimes it's just like I can just dive into a book.

00:28:13:24 - 00:28:35:07
James
So the next question is I haven't been a fan for very long, so you may have already covered this, but how do you feel about the rich enough to be a trollop less be rich enough to be a trollop? Lesbian trope. I've encountered it so much lately. I've been calling them lesbians with a dollar sign in the ass for short.

00:28:35:45 - 00:29:22:26
James
I'm on the fence about it on the one hand, historical context, but on the other so bored. I don't know if I've come across this trollop like this. So. So would that be like, rich enough to get away with this? I don't think I've come across it. So I'm missing some some media here because although maybe it's like shows like Elite and stuff like that where people are just ridiculously rich and good looking and so they can get away with doing basically anything.

00:29:25:22 - 00:29:54:12
James
Another one might be like the favorite where you have, you know, people in the Royal Court who are lesbians or bisexual women and they're getting away with it. There's not real controversy over it because the rich, what are you going to do? I thought they were actually going to do that in House of the Dragon with Rhaenyra and Alice and of really getting lesbian vibes from them.

00:29:54:12 - 00:30:24:05
James
And then they didn't do it. So I was really dissatisfied with that. But yeah, I don't think I've come across that. So but I would actually really appreciate it if you could leave some examples of that because that would actually really play into a video that I'm planning. Another one about being gay and having money, and I would really appreciate that so that I can check them out.

00:30:27:36 - 00:30:56:49
James
Okay. The next question is, could you walk us through your creative process of making video essays? It used to be pure chaos, but it's getting more organized now. It used to be literally like I would come up with an idea and I'd be like, Nick, we're going to do this. And then we would have to dive into either watching a TV show or reading a book or a manga or something like that.

00:30:57:43 - 00:31:27:25
James
And it was complete chaos. But lately it's been way more organized. So what we do now is we find a piece of media that we want to talk about like, for instance, I can use banana fish as a good example. I really wanted to make a video about banana fish. People had recommended me the end of May and said they wanted me to make a video about it.

00:31:28:06 - 00:31:55:04
James
I watched it. I fell in love with the anime. Um, Ash is alive always and forever, but having watched it, I'm like, okay, so I can do it. I can do a video where I kind of recap it, but what am I going to set? Like, what's the point of doing that? Like, of doing an hour long video, just recapping a TV show.

00:31:55:55 - 00:32:26:00
James
I know a lot of people do that on YouTube and they do quite well with those videos, but it's not something that I feel like I could do on a long term basis. I'm doing it on the second channel now with Interview with the Vampire, but that's like ten minute videos talking about an hour long episode and so trying to figure out what do we do, what can we say with this video so that it's not just a recap of an anime.

00:32:26:42 - 00:32:46:21
James
And in, in that particular case, I tried to get Nick to watch the anime and he hated it. He didn't. I think he got past I think he got the episode too. He got a bit further into the manga but hated the manga even more. So we just started kind of spitballing it and this is what we end up doing as we sit it.

00:32:46:42 - 00:33:19:55
James
When we were living together, we would sit at the kitchen table and just talk about it and we would end up talking about it for 3 hours, three or 4 hours. And somewhere in that discussion we would have found a theme. And with banana fish, for instance, the theme was the historical kind of connection between being gay and being a criminal.

00:33:21:23 - 00:33:51:16
James
And so then we we had our theme for the video, and a lot of people watched that video in particular. And, you know, the first probably 20 minutes are banana fish and then the next 30 minutes are talking about the history of gay criminals, basically. And then for the last like 5 minutes of the video, we round it back to banana fish and we kind of tie up the knot and that's kind of what we try to do.

00:33:51:46 - 00:34:19:35
James
Um, we try to we take a piece of media that where at least one of us is usually I'm excited about it or both of us is, um, Nick doesn't really watch a whole lot of stuff on their own, so it's usually stuff that I'm excited about or that I have forced upon him. And then we kind of take this thing that we're excited about and figure out the theme for it.

00:34:20:04 - 00:35:05:52
James
Um, there are some more recent examples would be Stranger Things, for instance, and how I wanted to do a video about Stranger Things. I wasn't really sure what to do with the video because I was like, okay, well I want to talk about Robin and Will and stuff like that. We barely mentioned either of them. I don't think we mentioned Robin at all in the video because it ended up becoming, you know, the sort of not how, you know, nostalgia or how nostalgia can really cloud history and how we look at history and how because we look at history a different way, we're not remembering it the right way.

00:35:06:09 - 00:35:36:10
James
And therefore we are, you know, doomed to repeat the mistakes of history. Um, and so that's another one. Sometimes it's very cut and clear, like with the, the new monsters out of the closet video is very of the newest one. That one didn't have a theme going into it. I was just like, I'm going to talk about recent horror movies and how they're getting clearer.

00:35:37:03 - 00:36:07:58
James
And I read a couple of books or read a bunch of articles and I just went to town and wrote the script. That's one of the rare scripts that I actually wrote myself. But yeah, that's basically the process. We figure out a show or movie that we're excited about and figure out an overarching theme for it so that it's not just, you know, 40 minutes about Spider-Man or something.

00:36:08:58 - 00:36:29:52
James
Excuse me, and then build off of it from there. Nick usually takes charge of the script because we'll sit down and we'll figure out, okay, how long is this video probably going to be? Is it going to be a half hour long or is it going to be an hour long? And from there we figure out, okay, how many parts are going to be in this video?

00:36:30:18 - 00:36:55:10
James
And There is always universally, always one more part than we plan every time. Every single time. So if we say it's going to have an introduction and then six parts, it will have an intro in seven parts every time. And that's usually because when the script is quote unquote finished, I jump into it and end up adding something.

00:36:58:17 - 00:37:21:09
James
And so, yeah, that's sort of a rambling answer. But that that's kind of the process that we do. We kind of sit down, we figure out, okay, what's the script, What's the structure of the script? How many parts are there? Okay, there's six parts. What is what is each part going to say? Because, you know, we know what the closing message is.

00:37:21:09 - 00:37:50:40
James
We know what the the the thesis statement is. And so we have to figure out, okay, there's six parts. How can we make sure that all of these parts lead to that message? And then when it's all wrapped up in the video and all of the smart stuff is done and which is mostly written by Nick, I do write, you know, a good chunk of the video, help write a good chunk of the videos, but not Nick does the bulk of it.

00:37:50:40 - 00:38:12:18
James
And then I do the bulk of the video editing, shooting, that kind of stuff on the other end. Um, so then once the script is done, I come in and I write the closer to it and you know, that's where I wrap everything up into a bow. And I'm like, okay, let's bring back the stuff that we talked about in part one and part two in the introduction.

00:38:12:18 - 00:38:50:18
James
Let's bring that back. And that way, when the video is over, you feel like you've had a complete experience. Uh, next question. Do you have any rituals or routines in your daily life other than taking vitamins? I don't I don't think I do. I probably should because I my days are a are a mess. Some days I will get up at like eight in the morning, which I know is not that early for a lot of people, but for me it's very early.

00:38:52:19 - 00:39:24:07
James
I'll get up at like eight in the morning and I'll start doing stuff. I will start whether it's setting up a set to shoot on or going out to, you know, maybe I need to get groceries or I need to go buy something for a video, um, whatever it might be. And I will spend the whole day working and then there are some days where I won't get out of bed until like five in the afternoon.

00:39:24:46 - 00:39:55:13
James
And it's not even like, Oh, I'm depressed. And so I'm laying in bed. It's just, well, I have nothing else to do. So I'm just going to lay here and watch Bob's Burgers. That's usually what I'm watching. Um, because and I don't know why that ends up happening, where sometimes I just kind of shut down for a day or two and, like, this week has been because I've been sick, I've been in bed a lot.

00:39:55:53 - 00:40:28:33
James
Basically I will my for most the last week my greatest energy expenditure has been getting up from bed walking into the living room and sitting on the couch and turning my PlayStation on and watching a TV show. Um, but, you know, I was sick, so I'll give myself a break there. But yeah, like, sometimes it will be like super productive days and other days are just non-existent.

00:40:29:02 - 00:40:57:37
James
And I wish I had more kind of routines in my day. I wish I had, like, a writing routine, for instance, where I could get up and, you know, make a smoothie, have some tea and start writing something, whether that be a script or a novel or a video essay. Um, and, you know, be able to build a routine around that.

00:40:58:17 - 00:41:29:07
James
Whereas I am a complete thump the microphone thing, whereas I am just a complete mess when it comes to routine, except when I'm editing, when I am editing a video, I go into a very strict routine, which is literally I wake up, I have some tea, I have a smoothie, I sit down at my computer, I edit a section.

00:41:30:48 - 00:41:55:10
James
And that's that's why my videos are all broken up into chapters, partially so that it's easier to come back to the video like if you have to take a break from it or something like that. But part but also partially so that it's easier to edit because this way, um, I can basically edit a small ten minute video and then it's like, okay, this is done.

00:41:56:06 - 00:42:18:28
James
And then when that is done, however long that takes, sometimes it might be, you know, as short as three or 4 hours, sometimes it might take 12 hours to edit the 10 minutes. It all depends on the videos that are required. How many videos need to be downloaded? Is it just you know, is it videos that I already know need to be there like B-roll from a movie?

00:42:18:41 - 00:42:56:38
James
Or do I need to find stuff like archive news footage which is much harder to find, Um, especially without giant watermarks on it. And so it can take a lot longer. But then no matter how long it if it takes like 12 hours, then I'll stop. I'll have dinner, I'll watch some videos on YouTube, I'll watch TV, show, and then I will go in and you know, if it's a if I got it done in a pretty short amount of time after I'm done eating and everything, I'll go do another one.

00:42:57:45 - 00:43:15:05
James
If it took a long time, I don't just stop. I go back and I do the audio edit for it, which is basically cutting out the arms and Oz and stuff like that, which I wish I could do with these podcasts because I am and a lot in the podcasts, but I don't have the patience to do it here.

00:43:18:48 - 00:43:50:07
James
And so going in and doing that audio edit and that way, you know, I can then get a shower, go to bed, you know, relax for a bit and then come back in the morning and I'm not starting from scratch. I'm already halfway done of something and I do that process. I always try and leave it so that something's unfinished, which I can imagine would drive a lot of people crazy, have it, you know, going to bed with something unfinished.

00:43:50:29 - 00:44:23:38
James
But for me, it's not going to bed with something unfinished. It's the kick in the ass I need the next day, the next morning to get started, because otherwise I might just end up, you know, being lethargic the next day and being like, oh, well, I'll get to it. But because it's literally hanging there on the screen and I leave the screen on on my editing computer, I leave it on all night so that when I leave the bedroom, it's final cut is staring at me and the video is staring at me and it's like I'm unfinished.

00:44:25:24 - 00:44:52:46
James
So it kind of gives me the kick in the ass. I need to get started on it right away. And then so I have that very strict routine when I'm editing videos for everything else, I have like nothing except I take vitamins when I as soon as I wake up in the morning along with my seizure and anxiety medication, and then I do that again at 930 at night, which if you've ever seen me stream, the streams are inevitably interrupted by my phone telling me to take my pills.

00:44:55:12 - 00:45:35:06
James
And yeah, other than that, I don't have any rituals or routines, but I should probably find something like yoga or science to kind of get a try to straighten out my mind. Um, next question is how do you stay inspired and creative but without burning out? Oddly, I, I've been doing this full time. I've been doing YouTube full time since May of 2021.

00:45:35:13 - 00:46:15:48
James
So for about a year and a half and before that I was doing it full time and working full time. Um, so which was exhausting, doing YouTube full time and working full time, for instance, the if you remember back in, I think February of 2021, um, I did a big long charity stream for a trans youth charity and we Nick and I played Ocarina of Time and I think 100% did it.

00:46:16:26 - 00:46:46:35
James
Um, it was like a, it was a 36 hour stream. I wish it was still on YouTube, but anything over 10 hours YouTube doesn't allow to be up. And I can't even they won't even let me download file to like, upload in chunks. So that sucks. But I did that. I we started that on a Friday evening after I had worked all day at my normal job, for instance, um, which was doing marketing for a school.

00:46:47:18 - 00:47:25:21
James
Um, so I, I really love doing this. I love coming up with the ideas for videos, I love shooting the videos, editing the videos, releasing the videos. Like all of it. I just, I love all of it. Even the really hard ones, like the Gay Panic video and the gay Holocaust video and stuff like that. The ones that are really hard to do and sometimes like I had to do for the Gay Panic video that took a year between me finishing the script and actually it and then the gay Holocaust video.

00:47:25:42 - 00:47:52:51
James
I took three weeks off after releasing part one. It was originally released as two parts. I released part one and then I took three weeks off before I even started editing part two because it was already dark. And part two was when we got to the camps. So it was already like hard to deal with, but I think that's probably like the longest break I took.

00:47:53:40 - 00:48:25:22
James
Um, I didn't even take a break when my mom died because of scheduling the banana Fish video actually was published the night my mom passed away. So technically I was working at my mom's bedside. So that was, that was interesting. Um, you know, there were I wasn't working. There were comments coming in on the video. People were commenting on it, but I wasn't.

00:48:25:22 - 00:48:50:16
James
I wasn't reading them. But, you know, that had been published at a I had scheduled that to be published at an odd time. But I love doing this so much. And that's why, you know, I'm so thankful for you guys for letting me do this, because I can't think of other than like making movies. I can't think of a job that would be more fun than this.

00:48:50:58 - 00:49:12:52
James
Um, that said, I don't do most of the writing I do on any given video. On average, I would say I do about 30% of the writing. Some videos like Monsters Out of the Closet. I did all the writing for the Queer as Folk video, a couple of other ones recently, the Gay Panic video, the gay Holocaust video.

00:49:12:52 - 00:50:09:55
James
I did all the writing on those, um, the earlier videos. Um, but Nick does get burnt out. Um, because doing the writing and the researching and everything is exhausting. And a lot of times before, um, we got so many patrons, we were entirely reliant on YouTube ad revenue. And so if we put out a video and it might be like an hour long video that we've just spent a month working on and we put it out and the views aren't there, it's like, okay, we need a new video out next week and then that fell on us to get out in the next week, which basically meant so so that we could pay rent that

00:50:09:55 - 00:50:43:04
James
month. And that basically meant Nick had to write between five and 10,000 words in two days so that we would have two days to shoot it and then I would have two days to edit it. Um, and then hope to God that YouTube didn't monetize it or pull some copyright shenanigans and stuff like that. So luckily that doesn't happen anymore because you guys are amazing and have made it so that we don't have to deal with that anymore.

00:50:43:55 - 00:51:05:11
James
Because even if a video doesn't do great, it's not the end of the world. We know everyone's going to be paid. So it's it is taking so much stress off of us to be able to do that. And that's all thanks to you guys. And sorry for this kind of just complete non-sequitur off into. Thank you, Val, but thank you.

00:51:07:13 - 00:51:31:40
James
Um, but yeah, Nick is definitely more prone to burn out because this isn't what Nick plans to be doing for the rest of their life. Nick wants to be a novelist. Nick has a novel that's been released. Gentlemen's club. Um, and that's what Nick wants to do. And this is, you know, probably a much easier and he's told me is a much easier job than any other one that he's ever had.

00:51:32:40 - 00:52:05:45
James
But it's not, you know, his dream job. It's not my dream job either. My dream job is making movies, but I kind of look at these as little movies and. So it's it's much easier for me to, um, just be excited about every new video that's going out. But though Nick is more prone to burn out, that's never stopped Nick from getting getting the work done.

00:52:06:01 - 00:52:34:03
James
They are. Nick's an incredible person who really pushes themselves so much harder than they really ought to. And that's another big thank you to you guys, is that you make it so that I can make sure that he's paid properly because he deserves to be paid properly. All right, now I'm done Just saying thank you for 10 minutes.

00:52:34:51 - 00:52:58:35
James
Three more questions. The next one is, why do you wear so many mock turtlenecks? Is this a Canadian thing or a turtlenecks? Just your favorite. Will Nick appear in a future video? What do you like to eat for breakfast? This is several questions. No, it's not a Canadian thing. Um. I am overweight and an odd amount of fat is held in my neck.

00:52:59:40 - 00:53:26:52
James
Um, I have, you know, a decent amount of belly fat. That's why you never see it on camera. The, you know, the bottom of the frame is, like, at my chest, but, you know, it's manageable. Um, if I wear the right clothes, I don't look horrible. Um, but my neck is so I think my neck looks incredibly fat, and so I wear turtlenecks to hide that.

00:53:27:39 - 00:53:59:16
James
That's it. Um, if I actually manage to lose the weight I want to lose, I'm probably going to stop wearing turtlenecks in every video because I'm not going to be so self-conscious about my jiggly double chin. So that's why I wear turtlenecks. Um, I actually have, um, the double sided fabric tape. It's meant for strapless dresses, but I use it for one turtleneck that I have in particular.

00:53:59:16 - 00:54:21:50
James
That's a very light fabric that I used to have to wear all the time because it was a light fabric so I could wear it in the summer and not sweat to death. And so I would have to take that. I would have to tape that to my neck so that it wouldn't fall down because it fell down, I would see the fat, the double chin and just get so self-conscious during editing.

00:54:21:50 - 00:54:49:46
James
And then I would have to reshoot things. So I would be using double sided tape to do that. As for Nick appearing in another video, Nick doesn't like being on camera very much. Even when we do streams together, Nick gets super self-conscious, but he does want to do a video about cyberpunk that he wants to do for the channel and I don't know when that's coming.

00:54:49:46 - 00:55:14:02
James
I don't know really a whole lot about that. We've talked about the look of it and stuff. I'm excited because I'll get to be behind the camera, so I'm really excited for that. But other than that, Nick will rarely be on camera, I think, like he has. I am definitely not telling him not to be on camera. It's a it's a decision that he's made.

00:55:16:51 - 00:55:40:30
James
And what do I like to eat for breakfast? Breakfast is my favorite meal because you can get away with just having protein for breakfast and you know, no one gives you a weird look because like, if you're having dinner, it's like, Oh, you're having steak or chicken. It's like, Oh, what's your side? And then it's like, well, maybe it's rice or potatoes or vegetables and it's like carbs, carbs, carbs, carbs.

00:55:40:55 - 00:56:06:30
James
Um, but for breakfast you can have bacon and eggs and sausages and there you go. And I can actually have toast because I found this bread called Carbonite that only has to grams of carbs per slice because it has so much fiber. Um, which has been a godsend because I love sandwiches and it has allowed me to continue to eat sandwiches.

00:56:07:19 - 00:56:33:05
James
Um, so yeah, next question. I mean, if we're getting personal, what's your favorite brand of toilet paper cashmere? In all seriousness, what's your favorite news from the last New York City Comic-Con and Werewolf by Night? How much did you love or hate it on thoughts on why the straight boy reviewers all seem to be shipping Ted man thing and Jack the titular werewolf.

00:56:33:23 - 00:57:07:01
James
I actually haven't gotten to watch it. Yes, I want to watch it around Halloween so that it's more of a seasonal treat kind of thing because I watched Hocus Pocus as soon as it came out. So there went my Halloween movie for the year. So yeah, Werewolf by night, I want to watch for Halloween, but I'm excited that the streets are shipping man thing and Jack that's that's that makes me excited to watch it after the the, uh, completely met the fourth wall breaking finale of She-Hulk.

00:57:07:01 - 00:57:29:47
James
I'm excited to see what Marvel does with when they become playful. Okay, the last question is actually two questions. Uh, first, what are some non-English queer stories in media that you would recommend bonus points for non anime or Korean Manoa? Because I've read and watched a lot of those. Second, have you read My Brother's Husband? And if so, what do you think of it?

00:57:30:36 - 00:57:55:24
James
I have not read my brother's husband, but it's in my to be read list. As for what are some non English queer stories that you would recommend? Um, I mentioned this one in my best gay movies list, which is Mandrake Gora, which is a movie out of the Czech Republic. Um, I don't think it is the Czech Republic anymore.

00:57:55:24 - 00:58:18:37
James
Is it? Maybe it is, but it's from what is or was the Czech Republic. And it's a very dark movie. Um, like tonally, but an incredible, incredible movie. Another one. Oh, let me find the title here.

00:58:26:20 - 00:58:33:19
Speaker 2
Um. Oh, I can't remember the.

00:58:33:19 - 00:59:18:52
James
Name of the movie, but see, here, you know, Okay, I know where I would be pretty sure I only have two examples because I don't watch a whole lot of foreign films. And it's not even because I'm like, don't like foreign films. It's because I have a hard time with subtitles. Um, I believe I have it listed here.

00:59:21:01 - 01:00:24:25
James
Uh, that, that, that, uh, okay. I think it would be at the very end. Sorry for the random speaking. I'm trying to scrub through a Vimeo video. Uh oh. So yes, before the fall, which is, I believe, a German movie. Um, yeah, it's, uh, German movie came out in 2004 and it is about two gay teenagers, young adults.

01:00:24:55 - 01:00:57:18
James
Um, and, uh, kind of how they are drastically affected in a very sad way by being in and around the Hitler Youth. And it's a very sad movie, but it's a very good movie. Um, I used a lot of footage of it in pink triangles because I was like, Oh, cute German twinks. This will help me get through the horrible other stuff.

01:00:59:29 - 01:01:23:49
James
Um, but yeah, those would be my only two examples. Um, at least off the top of my head, I'm sure if I like, went through my brain, I would be able to think of other ones. Um, and of course neither of them are happy. I, I'm sorry about that, but yeah, so those are the questions you guys asked.

01:01:23:54 - 01:01:48:37
James
I hope my answers were mostly satisfactory. Um, so, yeah, I will be back on Tuesday with another podcast. I have no idea what's going to be so wish me luck. And then after that, I believe Nick will be, uh, coming to visit from his mom's place, which is like 4 hours away. And we'll be recording a bunch of podcasts for you guys.

01:01:49:30 - 01:01:59:47
James
Um, until then again, thank you guys so much for being patrons. I love you all, and I hope you have a fantastic weekend.

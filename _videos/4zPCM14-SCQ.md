<u>[Fade in on a projector fading in, pointed just past the camera.]</u> 

You're sitting in a packed theater. The lights go down, and you can hear a whisper of anticipation ripple through the crowd, but then it goes silent. Before the movie even begins, you're already on edge.

<u>[Cut to black, then fade in on bed in a dark bedroom. A copy of the book It rests on a shelf.]</u> 

Or maybe you're sitting alone at night. In bed, you feel safe until you open up the book on your bedside table, a Stephen King classic that gives you chills even though you've read it ten times.

You're curled up on your couch. It's late at night, the lights are off, and you're about to watch the latest episode of a TV show that gives you nightmares.

<u>[Fade to black.]</u> 

These three situations all end with a smile as you laugh at yourself for being afraid.

<u>[Clips from various horror movies.]</u>

We love being afraid. Horror movies, books, and TV shows give us a thrill that's hardwired into us as human beings, the thrill of being afraid, having your pulse race, muscles tense, but knowing in the end that you're safe.

I fell in love with horror movies when I was six years old. That's when I saw *Friday the 13th: Part 7: A New Blood* for the very first time. It was my first slasher movie and my first horror movie in general, and besides being kind of shocked to see blood on the screen for the first time, I wasn't the least bit scared. (Granted, *Friday the 13th Part 7* is more akin to an *X-Men* movie than *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*. The main character literally kills Jason by using psychic powers.) But it was still a horror movie and a great gateway to the genre.

For the next two decades, I devoured that genre. I had a shelf dedicated to my horror movie VHSs, DVDs, and now Blu-Rays. *Halloween*, *Friday the 13th*, *Nightmare on Elm Street*, *Hellraiser*, *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, all the greats. I eventually moved on to the grandparents of the horror genre, the Universal Monsters: Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy, and the Invisible Man. And in my midteens, after letting *everyone know that I was gay* and getting to know more people in the queer community, I came to a realization:

Gays really love horror movies.

<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Of course, there are exceptions (I still can't get my roommate to watch 2017’s *It*), but for the most part, it seemed like every gay guy and girl absolutely adored horror movies, from the top-tier ones like *The Exorcist*, to the bottom-of-the-rung direct-to-video sequels, to *The Leprechaun*, *Child's Play*, and *Sleepaway Camp*. There's even a massive amount of gay-themed slasher movies on Netflix &mdash; usually involving frat brothers. 

So, where did this gay fascination with horror come from? <mark v>James Jenkins of Valancourt Books notes that the connection between gay fiction and horror goes</mark> all the way <mark v>back to the gothic novels of the</mark> <mark v>early 1800s</mark>. <mark v>Many gothic authors, like Matthew Lewis, William Thomas Beckford, and Francis Latham, were gay,</mark> and that reflected in their work. <mark v>According to Jenkins</mark>:

In 1890, Lippincott's Monthly Magazine commissioned a short story by <mark fc=false>then-little-known author Oscar Wilde</mark> that would eventually become the novel *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. 

The story follows the titular Dorian Gray, who has had a portrait painted by an artist named Basil. Once he's seen the portrait, he wishes that it would grow old and age instead of him. And his wish having been granted, the portrait becomes a twisted reflection of Dorian's deviance and vices. The wish for eternal youth is certainly present in gay culture, but the dandyism of The Picture of Dorian Gray is much more obvious in other parts of the work. For instance, <mark>when Basil has his first meeting with Dorian Gray:</mark>

<u>[Direct quotes of the novel appear on-screen. James reads these out in a low-pass filtered voice.]</u> 
> <mark>When our eyes met, I felt I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.</mark>

And then later, saying:

> <mark></mark>We were quite close...
>
> Almost touching.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=sf1 %}>

This is false. According to [Wilde’s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde), by 1890, Wilde had published a poetry collection, gone on a speaking tour of the US, written a play, and edited a monthly magazine. He’d also written multiple short stories.

<h2>BASIL/DORIAN</h2>

The novel starts out in Basil's home where he and Lord Henry are spending a day together. In the middle of the room stands the portrait of Dorian, which leads to the two men talking about him. We learn that he is very important to Basil and the way in which he speaks about him is very personal and has a homoerotic undertone. <mark>Basil tells Lord Henry of the first meeting with Dorian:</mark>

> <mark>When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself</mark> [...] Something seemed to tell me I was in the verge of a terrible crisis in my life [...] I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room. (13)

Artists are often referred to as eccentric and passionate, which can make this very astonishing reaction of his to be only fascination for an artistic object as it was said before. But these are very strong feelings of one man towards another. This fact can never be disregarded or diminished and sets the tone for homoeroticism. Basil's physical reaction can very well be seen as physical attraction and the fear he shows can be the fear that is associated with coming out, the fear of going against the norm and someone finding out. 

As we learn more about Basil and Dorian's first meeting the homoerotic theme becomes more tangible. Basil says <mark>“we were quite close, almost touching</mark>. Our eyes met again” (14). This is a great indication that shows a meeting beyond aesthetics only. It shows an emotional, possibly even erotic, emotional connection between the men. In many ways this interaction can be seen as flirtatious and certainly not a manner in which men were supposed to relate to each other. It shows the men sharing looks and glances, noticing the physical closeness and feeling something for one another. Dorian seems to share this feeling. Basil says: “[Dorian], too, felt that we were destined to know each other” (14). Since Dorian feels the same way we can assume that what is shared between them is not a matter of an artist and his subject, but a man and another man. We also learn that Basil flatters Dorian and finds “strange pleasure in saying things that [he] know[s] [he] shall be sorry for having said” (19). If we now consider the fact that Basil flatters Dorian constantly by giving him compliments, an interpretation of this as courtship is not that farfetched. A heterosexual friendship between two men does not consist of this kind of flirtation and courtship. Basil saying to Dorian something he will regret having said also indicates that he has uttered words he would normally not say to anyone else. Thus, it seems clear that his feelings for Dorian are something new and unfamiliar to him. Presumptions that this is some sort of sexual identity being awakened are easily made. 

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Later in the novel, Lord Henry, a dear friend of the artist Basil, says to Dorian:

> <mark></mark>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheeks with shame.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p14" %}>

Shame has a very central role in the novel as well, being closely connected to secrecy. Rasmussen says that the “relationship between inclusivity and coming out, [is] a relationship that often situates the closet as a zone of shame and exclusion” (144). Lord Henry, when issuing his powerful influence over Dorian, notices the distress the young man undergoes and he also says,

> <mark></mark>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, daydreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheeks with shame. (26)

Oscar <mark>Wilde does not present any of the characters</mark> in *The Picture of Dorian Gray* as *overtly* <mark>homosexual</mark>. <mark>In fact, Lord Henry is married, and Dorian begins dating an actress</mark>, but he's more in love with the art of her acting. In fact, when she tells him that she'll stop acting to be with him, he dumps her, and he's not the slightest bit upset to hear about her suicide. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p16" %}>
<h2>EFFEMINACY</h2>

*The Picture of Dorian Gray* comes across as a very effeminate novel, both in its presentation and in the way the characters are described. The novel is in fact presented in a rather 'straight' fashion when the homoerotic theme is downplayed when not explicitly stated. But effeminacy comes across not only in the way the characters are presented, but in the language Wilde uses to show a rather “feminine” world. <mark>Wilde does not present any of the characters</mark> as <mark>homosexual</mark>. <mark>In fact, Lord Henry is married and Dorian falls in love with an actress</mark>, but both these relationships are very superficial. It is a very straight language in that sense, but on a closer look we see it is not the case. By writing in the manner that he does, Wilde himself shows an effeminate streak as it will be shown further down. 

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In 2005, Joseph Carroll, professor of philosophy and literature at the University of Missouri, wrote, 

> <mark></mark>Among heterosexuals, feminine characteristics act as a stimulus or trigger for male sexual desire. One chief reason effeminacy can be easily integrated with a homoerotic persona is that effeminacy indirectly suggests that the effeminate male could himself be an object of male desire.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p17" %}>

Feminine behaviour by men has more or less always been looked down upon, even during Wilde's time. Standfort points out that “feminine characteristics are less valued than masculine ones, in general, but especially in men” and that “transgressions into femininity by men are more negatively valued than transgressions into masculinity by women” (599). Schaffer believes that male aesthetes to “justify this behaviour, they had to create a visual style which metonymically associated themselves with women while distinctly affirming their superiority” (42). This means that during those days it was more acceptable to take on this feminine and aesthetic lifestyle for men like Wilde, who is believed to have been a dandy. Carroll states,

> <mark></mark>Among heterosexuals, feminine characteristics act as a stimulus or trigger for male sexual desire. One chief reason effeminacy can be easily integrated with a homoerotic persona is that effeminacy indirectly suggests that the effeminate male could himself be an object of male desire. (296)

Early in the story, before the more supernatural elements kick in, Dorian is upset that the portrait will forever remain beautiful and young, while he will wither and age. 

> <mark num=1>The tears welled in his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he were praying.</mark>

<mark num=2>Joseph Carroll finds scenes of women lying prone and weeping are common enough in Victorian fiction, but scenes depicting males in that posture are vanishingly rare.</mark> 

<mark num=3>Once the novel saw its final publication</mark>, at least for the 1800s, <mark num=4>critics zeroed in on the effeminacy of the novel, especially the main character.</mark> Over the next century, critics and fans would discover the more overt homosexuality in Oscar Wilde's most famous work.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p18" %}>

<mark num=3>Following the release of the novel</mark> <mark num=4>the reviews that criticised it paid attention to the effeminacy of Dorian Gray.</mark> In the novel when Dorian is displeased he “made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather taken a fancy” (24). One reviewer calls the characters puppies, noting Dorian's behaviour in the previous quote to be improper for a boy of twenty years (Mason, 18). 

Carroll, likewise, views Dorian's behaviour to be more fit for a woman than for a man, no matter his age. In the novel Dorian is upset that the painting will forever remain beautiful while his beauty and youth will wither: <mark num=1>“The tears welled in his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.</mark> (35). <mark num=2>Carroll finds “[s]cenes of women lying prone and weeping are common enough in Victorian fiction; scenes depicting males in that posture are vanishingly rare”</mark> (297).

Now, instead of pulling quotes from novels and intellectual articles for the rest of the video, I'm going to start focusing on more modern interpretations of gay horror. And I'd like to talk about the world’s the most famous monster... that you never knew was analogously queer.

</james>

Frankenstein: "IT'S ALIVE!!" *Grabbed by two people* "In the name of god! Now I know what it feels like to be God!"

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein: Or, the Modern Prometheus*. Victor Frankenstein, the titular mad scientist, shows little to no interest in his  wife-to-be and is determined to create life on his own: his own perfect man. (Something explored without subtlety in *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*.) But when digging up the body parts that he'll eventually use to compile the monster, he makes sure to pick the... *sexiest* body parts he can find. He wants an Adonis, just like Frank-N-Furter. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Once born against his own free will, as we all are, Frankenstein's monster is rejected by its creator as something terrible, a regretful mistake that ought to be done away with. He even flees from the monster because it's so hideous. Frankenstein's reaction to the birth of his creation isn't that far off from the reaction of many overly religious parents when they find out that their child is gay. They look at them as monsters: ungodly. And although most of these parents don't actually attempt to *kill* their children (though that does happen) they may cut them out of their lives; an emotional murder, if you will. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But at the same time, there is a homoerotic subtext between Victor Frankenstein and his monster. The monster tracks down his creator, and Victor discovers that the monster is intelligent, well-read, and curious. He is, ostensibly, everything a man like Victor would want a lover. There's a direct connection between them. Victor's repulsion toward the monster could read as the Victorian equivalent of “no fats, no fems”. 

Every time Frankenstein's creature (sometimes referred to as Adam) is seen by the local population, he's met with horror. He hasn't done anything to them, but they look at him as a monster anyway. And rejection drives him to become the monster they see him as. Eventually, Adam begs Victor to create for him a mate. He just wants someone like him, someone who knows his struggles, someone to share his life with. He, like any other person, deserves as much. (Sound familiar?) 

Though Victor initially agrees, he eventually destroys the potential bride. Adam the monster is not allowed to have a mate, not allowed to have someone to love and be loved by, because he's a monster. He's not like normal people. He doesn't deserve to have what everyone else does. Because... he is different. And so, you see the parallels between Frankenstein's monster... and being gay.

Now, this all changed a little bit with the film adaptation. James Whales, himself a gay director, helmed 1931’s *Frankenstein* and its 1935 sequel, *The Bride of Frankenstein*. <mark x>Whales, oddly, made sure to remove the more overt homoerotic subtext between Victor and his monster by adding the character of Fritz for Victor to speak with and by making the monster mute, and also making Victor much more socially active.</mark> Off-topic, but Fritz is the character we've all come to known as Igor, for some reason. Also, Victor is inexplicably renamed Henry in the movie, but I'm gonna stick to calling him Victor for the sake of consistency. <mark>Victor is also much more socially active in the movies</mark>, as I said, <mark>adding a further layer of separation between him and the monster.</mark> 

</james>

In both *Frankenstein* and *The Bride of Frankenstein*, Whale emphasises Victor's heterosexuality by replacing Victor's solitary relationship with the Creature by a more social and public one. <mark x>The possibility of any social interaction between Victor and the Creature that might result in a homosocial / homosexual subtext is basically removed by Whale since, whereas Shelley's Creature is highly intelligent and intellectually attractive for Victor, Whale's monster cannot speak in the 1931 film, and can barely articulate a few words in the 1935 sequel.</mark> Whale's 1935 film also offers the Creature a female companion, if only for a limited time, when in the novel Victor destroys the fen1a1e creature he is working on, thus eliminating any potential heterosexual competition for the Creature's attention. In both films, Whale also chooses to have Victor proceed with his experiments with the help of either Fritz or Dr Pretorius, and other characters actually witness his work. <mark x>This socially active Victor</mark> <mark x>prevents consequently any reading of his personal motive in his making of the creature and the possible relationship that would ensue.</mark> Whale still hints at Victor's possible homosexuality in his relationship to Fritz, and most specifically in ali his scenes with Dr Pretorius, a character culturally encoded as 'deviant', i.e. homosexual, who thus underscores Whale's subtle, ironic retelling of Shelley's story - he replaces Victor's homosexual interest in the Creature with another man.

The character of Elizabeth in both Whale's films and Branagh's 1994 film reinforces further Victor's heterosexuality. <mark x>Each film implicates Elizabeth in Victor's experience, and thus removes the option of a homosexual reading of the creation scene. Whale modifies this scene in both films to incorporate an audience, one which includes Elizabeth.</mark> In fact, in Whale's *Frankenstein*, Victor at first refuses to permit Dr Waldman and his friend Victor Moritz to disturb his experiment, and he specifically instructs Fritz not to allow anyone in. However, when Elizabeth asks him to open the door, he yields and actually shows loving concern for her. The tone that Frankenstein uses to talk to Moritz also differs significantly from the one he uses with Elizabeth, another instance of his heterosexual attachment to her. As for Branagh, although he does not include Elizabeth in his creation scene, he adds an extra scene beforehand. Fearing that Victor might be involved with another woman, Elizabeth decides to go to Geneva to ask him to come home with her. Although Victor stays to pursue his experiment, the preceding scene is reinforces Victor's commitment to Elizabeth. To a large extent, bath directors seem to offer readings of the novel that emphasize the characters' heterosexuality without including Shelley's critique of her male characters, and her deliberate openness regarding questions of sexuality.

Further gay subtext can be <span stat:id="malaprop">gleamed</span> from 1941's *The Wolf Man*. The idea of being a normal man by day and then a deviant at night was one that clung to the identities of a lot of gay men at the time and now. And, you know, kind of birthed furries. 

So as you can see, classic horror represented the queer experience, whether the initial authors intended it to or not. The sense of hiding, being rejected and doomed to never know true love. Of being looked at as a monster in the eyes of the public, even if you've never done anything to hurt them; the monster coming for your children, the mad scientist going against nature, the beast unable to control its own urges, the creature born against God's will. That's what being gay was and, to some extent, still is. And so we identified with the monsters, not so much the heroes. 

But we wouldn't be the monsters forever. In a time when the gay community was being ravaged by AIDS, a bloodborne disease not entirely separated from the plague-bringing vampire birthed by Bram Stoker, Hollywood would, unbeknownst to itself, make us the hero.

## Part Two: America's New Nightmare

<compare>
<james span=3 {% include timecode %}>

American horror movies went through a revolution of sorts during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, shifting to more sci-fi than horror. Aliens from other worlds and creatures born of nuclear fallout peppered cinemas across the country. Movies about the horrors of the nuclear bombs, such as *Godzilla*, were easy enough to figure out. <mark fc=false>There wasn't a whole lot of subtext to Godzilla being a byproduct of the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</mark> The sci-fi and alien movies were a bit more cleverly coded though. Although never clearly stated, aliens were communists. They were the Russians, the Chinese, the Cubans or Vietnamese. They were infiltrating the wholesomeness of America and preparing to destroy it from within. They represented the other, the un-American, which for conservatives at the time meant a whole lot more than just communists. It also meant civil rights leaders, women's rights activists, and homosexuals. *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, *The Thing from the Other World*<sup class="add">[sic: *The Thing from Another World*]</sup>, and even *Plan 9 from Outer Space* directed by the infamously queer Ed Wood are just some examples of such films.

This is false. Per the Wikipedia article on the original Godzilla film and the Overly Sarcastic Productions video on kaiju, Godzilla was canonically a byproduct of nuclear testing, not the US bombing Japan.

*Godzilla* isn't an American horror movie, it's a Japanese film. A heavily re-edited Americanized version of the film, called *Godzilla, King of Monsters*, was created and released in the U.S. in 1957, two years after the original. [Per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla,_King_of_the_Monsters!#Filming_and_dubbing), "overt references to the atom bomb and hydrogen bomb, such as the bombing of Nagasaki, the Bikini Island tests, radioactive contamination of tuna by American and Russian bomb tests, were omitted." The original Japanese version was not officially available in the United States until the 2000s. However, [the Americanized version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yzKSjmATFs) did retain some of the original political content - Godzilla is said to have been "resurrected due to the repeated experiments of H-bombs," the monster is still a fairly clear allegory for the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (see the opening narration: "This is Tokyo, once a city of six million people. What has happened here was caused by a force which, up until a few days ago, was entirely beyond the scope of man's imagination. Tokyo, a smoldering memorial to the unknown, an unknown which, at this very moment, still prevails and could at any time lash out with its terrible destruction anywhere else in the world."), and the use of the "oxygen destroyer" clearly mirrors the debate over if/when nuclear weapons should be used.

After the Vietnam War, horror began to take a more inward look at America. Movies like *Psycho*, which I'll talk more about in Part 3, *Night of the Living Dead*, and *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre* looked at the horror that already existed in America, the homegrown evils. *Night of the Living Dead* for instance was a barely veiled allegory for the burgeoning American right wing - the racists and bigots refusing to pass on, even returning from the dead. The introspection of horror and the 60s and 70s made a lot of people in America very uncomfortable. The horror was no longer coming from without, but from within. Tobe Hooper's *Texas Chain Saw* and Wes Craven's *The Hills Have Eyes* and *The Last House on the Left*, all showing how "normal" Americans can turn, how they could easily become corrupted, evil, willing to kill their own countrymen.

Then in the late 70s and early 80s, a new form of horror arrived in America, one that, at least at first, seemed to leave good Christian Americans alone: <q>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome</q> - AIDS. <mark>On June 5, 1981, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention</mark> <mark>reported clusters of pneumonia</mark> <mark>among gay men in</mark> New York and <mark>Los Angeles.</mark> <mark>Over the next 18 months, otherwise healthy men of a certain sexual persuasion began dropping dead in every major city in the country.</mark> The CDC <mark>initially called this <q>GRID - Gay Related Immune Deficiency</q>.</mark> <mark>It wasn't until August of 1982 that it was officially named AIDS.</mark> It would be another two years before the cause of the syndrome, a retrovirus called the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, was discovered. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.wiki_aids at="History of spread, 1981-1982: From GRID to AIDS" %}>

The AIDS epidemic officially began <mark>on June 5, 1981, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</mark> in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report newsletter <mark>reported unusual clusters of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)</mark> caused by a form of Pneumocystis carinii (now recognized as a distinct species Pneumocystis jirovecii) <mark>in five homosexual men in</mark> <mark>Los Angeles.<sup>[83]</sup></mark>

<mark>Over the next 18 months, more PCP clusters were discovered among otherwise healthy men in cities throughout the country,</mark> along with other opportunistic diseases (such as Kaposi's sarcoma<sup>[84]</sup> and persistent, generalized lymphadenopathy<sup>[85]</sup>), common in immunosuppressed patients.

In June 1982, a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in Southern California suggested that a sexually transmitted infectious agent might be the etiological agent,<sup>[86]</sup> and <mark>the syndrome was initially termed "GRID", or gay-related immune deficiency.<sup>[87]</sup></mark>

Health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not homosexual men. The same opportunistic infections were also reported among hemophiliacs,<sup>[88]</sup> users of intravenous drugs such as heroin, and Haitian immigrants – leading some researchers to call it the "4H" disease.<sup>[89][90]</sup>

As far as I can tell, the CDC never used the name GRID.

In the meantime, political pundits across the country on both the right and left declared that AIDS was a moral punishment.

As half of America panicked over AIDS and the other half welcomed it as a biblical cleansing or at best ignored its existence, a new trend had developed in American horror movies: the teenage slasher. The slasher movie grew out of the fear-of-your-fellow-Americans genere, namely *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre*, and really found its place in pop culture with the 1978 release of *Halloween*. John Carpenter's masterpiece jumpstarted the slasher genre and also created a template that, in the time of AIDS, would become the most prevalent theme in horror: namely, the virgin lives. 

Basically every slasher movie in the late 70s and early 80s followed this format, exemplified by the *Friday the 13th* series in which camp counselors are murdered, literally for having sex. You see, a pair of counselors were off doing the dirty when Jason Voorhees, a developmentally challenged camper, was swimming. When he began to drown, they weren't there to save him because they were having sex. His mother then kills the counselors in question, and when the camp reopens many years later, she returns to exact her vengeance on a new generation of horny teenagers. Then she gets her head cut off, and Jason, all grown up, comes to kill the counselors who killed his mom, the ones who didn't let him drown...? See, apparently Jason survived the drowning and has been living in the woods around Crystal Lake ever since for like two decades, and has never told anyone that he was alive, never tried to find his mother... just kind of built a house for himself out there... Yeah the logic doesn't really add up.

Suffice it to say, the moral of the *Friday the 13th* series was have sex and get a machete to the head. This became uber-obvious once aids became widely known, it wasn't just a moral issue to not have sex before marriage, it was a life-or-death one, at least for the people who didn't assume that only gays got AIDS. <u>[laughs]</u>

Then came Wes Craven's seminal work *A Nightmare on Elm Street*, telling the story of teenager Nancy Thompson as she is stalked by a killer that can murder you in your dreams. *A Nightmare on Elm Street* continued to play into the fear-your-fellow-Americans genre; Freddy Krueger, the killer, was once upon a time just another man working in the town of Springwood, but eventually it was discovered that he was a child killer, and later confirmed in the series a child molester. When his murder trial ended in a mistrial due to the police failing to get the proper search warrant, the parents in Springwood exacted vigilante justice against Krueger, burning him alive. But Freddy didn't stay dead, and returned to Springwood as a dream demon hunting down the children of those who had killed him. Nancy was one of those children. At the end of the movie Krueger is defeated and Nancy lives happily ever after, except for a tacked on stinger ending that Wes Craven hated until the day he died.

*Freddy's Revenge* breaks with the traditional formula of the slasher movie by having the main character be a male, Jesse. Definitely an interesting move in 1985, but one that just doesn't quite work. Jesse's family has recently moved to Springwood, coincidentally into the house that Nancy lived in in *Part One*. Shortly after moving into the house, Jesse begins to have nightmares that he soon discovers are eerily similar to the ones the house's former occupant had. Finally, Jesse meets Freddy directly in a dream, and spends the rest of the movie trying to stay awake and convince people that he's possessed by the child killer. Freddy is defeated in the end, of course, but not until the movie has completely subverted the slasher genre by turning Jesse, and not his would-be girlfriend Lisa, into the damsel in distress. In fact, the movie ends with Lisa needing to come to Jesse's rescue. Jesse is quite obviously put in the female role in the movie.

The gayness of the film was immediately picked up by the queer audience, and even became a favorite to have on TVs and gay bars in the late 80s. Besides the leather bar scene - and honestly, how could you not tell that that scene was gay?

"I'm lying in bed and I'm a pietà and the candles are dripping and they're bending like phalluses and white wax is dripping all over. It's like I'm the center of a [...] bukkake video." He has felt betrayed since he knew the filmmakers were aware he was gay, but closeted, and thus had considerable leverage over him in having him <mark num=3>perform a role that, combined with his performance as a gay teen in *Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean* the year before, led to him being typecast as gay, which called attention to what he was trying to avoid discussing and would have forestalled him getting any significant roles in 1980s Hollywood.<sup>[12]</sup></mark>

In particular, Patton blames Chaskin, who he says claimed the subtext arose from how Patton played the part. "I love when [he] uses the word 'subtext,'" he complained. "Did you actually go to a freshman English course in high school? This is not subtext." In 2016 he said Chaskin "sabotage[d]" him. "Nobody ever affected my confidence — the boys that threw rocks at me, nobody — but this man did." <mark num=1>Chaskin denied for years that there was a gay subtext in his screenplay,</mark> instead he at one point told a reporter that Patton simply had played the part "too gay". <mark num=4>The emotional stress of the film led Patton to leave acting shortly afterwards for a career in interior decorating.<sup>[12]</sup> </mark>

While Chaskin has tried to reach out and apologize to Patton over the years, with limited success, he maintains that Patton's "interpretations of Jesse were choices that he made ... I have to believe that he 'got it' and that was how he decided to play it." In 2010, <mark num=2>Chaskin finally admitted it was a deliberate choice on his part. "Homophobia was skyrocketing and I began to think about our core audience—adolescent boys—and how all of this stuff might be trickling down into their psyches," he explained. "My thought was that tapping into that angst would give an extra edge to the horror."<sup>[12]</sup></mark>

David Chaskin is not gay. I looked far and wide but could find no mention of him being gay, and his comments about the film appear to come from a heterosexual perspective; [in a 2007 interview](http://www.bloodygoodhorror.com/bgh/interviews/09/19/2007/david-chaskin), Chaskin says the film's subtext "was intended to play homophobic rather than homoerotic" and that "one might argue that the entire movie is a metaphor -- Jesse is, in the end, finally able to control the monster inside him (his latent homosexuality) with the love of a good woman. Maybe they should show this film at one of those evangelical deprogramming sessions where they try to “fix” gay people into regular Americans." In light of these comments and the homophobic stereotypes in the film itself, James' comments on the film are perhaps overly generous. The "basis" of this video essay, Harry Benshoff's *Monsters in the Closet*, is more critical of the film.

Patton's character in *Come Back to the Five and Dime* is more accurately characterized as a pre-transition transgender girl. (Patton plays the character as a teen, and a different actor, a cis woman, plays her as an adult.) Though "gay teen" more-or-less works as well, at least for how it was perceived at the time.

Oddly enough, James omits mention that Mark Patton is gay, while claiming that Chaskin is gay. The film itself didn't "put the brakes on" Patton's acting career - he could have still gotten roles, [and was actually offered a role as a gay character on a TV show - but the emotional stress of dealing with homophobia and being forced to hide his sexuality, all during the AIDS crisis, led to him choosing to quit.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/louispeitzman/the-nightmare-behind-the-gayest-horror-film-ever-made) People like Chaskin took advantage of Patton because he was closeted.

As a horror movie, *The Lost Boys* isn't exactly scary, but it definitely kick-started a lot of gay kids into puberty.

The 90s was pretty much a dead zone for gay horror, but in 2005, we got the first truly gay horror movie with *Hellbent*. There's no subtext here; this is as gay as horror gets. The majority of the movie takes place in a West Hollywood Halloween party, for God's sake! And the movie? Well, the movie’s ridiculous, but in a good way. Most of the characters are more preoccupied with getting laid than the killings that are actually going on around them, which, admittedly, is a convention of the slasher genre, but for some reason, in *Hellbent*, it feels even more silly than usual. “Oh, there's a crazed killer out there murdering my friends. I need a hookup as soon as possible!” One thing I can say for the movie, though, is that although it was made in the early 2000s, it actually feels like a mid-80s classic slasher movie. It ignores the more polished aesthetic of horror movies at the time for a more grainy, retro feel. It was likely just a byproduct of having such a low budget, but I definitely count it in the movie's favor.

Anyway, back to the plot. It turns out that Chase is also a witch, and some nasty supernatural occurrences start happening around town once he gets there, which puts Caleb on edge.

There's also this scene. [Tracking shot in a public-school shower. One character hits another in the rear with a towel whip.] And this one. [Close up of two characters.

This brings us to the final conflict, and the point at which the film pretty much whips the audience in the face with the homoerotic symbolism: <mark>In the climactic scene, the two men hurl magic translucent white globs of power at each other</mark> as Chase begs for Caleb's consent.

To be fair, the obligatory girl-girl make-out scenes in modern slasher flicks demonstrates that producers don't have a much higher opinion of male horror fans.

Now, before I bring this video to a close, I'd like to mention a movie that I watched, and you shouldn't. In doing my research for this, I was told over and over again to watch the movie *1313 Haunted Frat* from 2011, and I did. Basically, a frat house filled with boys walking around with their grandpa's white underwear is being haunted by a crazy woman who possesses them. That's it. There's no end of the story, there's no story, there's barely a plot, there's less acting talent than in a typical porn shoot, and I don't know what the hell this is, to be honest. This scene here, this goes on for 15 minutes. He walks around the house like this for 15 minutes! In this shower scene, 8 minutes! In this random-ass scene of proto-Zac Efron touching himself, 7 minutes! The bulk of the movie’s 1 hour and 15 minute runtime is made up of scenes like this. The other five or so minutes are made up of this guy trying to get his frat brothers to help him write a history of the frat and discovering that it was built on the site of a destroyed mental institution. I was convinced that I was watching a porno that had all the sex cut out, honestly. I mean, the acting, the directing, the blocking, they're all porno quality. No, no, that's mean. The blocking is actually much worse than it is in a porno. Now that you've been warned off of ever watching this disaster of a photo play, I'll do the actual ending to the video.

*1313 Haunted Frat* is part of a whole series of horror films beginning with "1313." They're all directed by [David DeCoteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_DeCoteau), who has a long, long history of making low budget, direct-to-video films. Since about the year 2000, he's made many, many extremely low budget homoerotic horror films, targeted at an audience of young women and gay men. In 2011, the year *1313 Haunted Frat* was released, he also made (as in, directed, wrote, and produced) five other *1313* films. In 2012, he made 8 *1313* films alongside several other movies. DeCoteau is also openly gay.

I am uncertain what kinds of sources may have recommended this movie to James.

Throughout the 20th century and early into the 21st, gayness has remained coded in horror movies, with some minor, very nice exceptions. Jesse from *A Nightmare on Elm Street* isn't gay, but he's gay. The boys from *The Lost Boys* and *The Covenant* aren't gay, but they're gay. Actual gay characters did show up in some movies, like David in *The Bride of Chucky*, Luis in *American Psycho*, and Tom in *Scream 3* and Robbie in *Scream 4*, but they were all supporting characters with no real arc and not a whole lot to do in the story. Like every other genre in Hollywood, the LGBT community has mostly been left out of horror movies. Unless we're in a doomed love affair, a la *Brokeback Mountain*, or doomed to die in general, like in *Milk* or *Boys Don't Cry*, LGBT characters don't get a whole lot of attention. Considering how niche the horror genre is, it's kind of amazing that we've gotten as much mainstream attention as we have, even when it's as coded as it is. It's usually pretty hidden, but if we look hard enough, we can find ourselves in these movies. Sometimes, we don't have to look that hard at all. But there is one instance in which Hollywood has been more than happy to portray the LGBT community in both horror and mainstream movies. It's not a new trend; in fact, it's been around long before the gay-rights movement brought us into public light. We can always be the main draw for a movie if we're the killer.

Tom Prinze in *Scream 3* is not gay. [The original script has a scene where he asks out a female character and then a male character (both reject him), but the scene was not in the actual movie and may or may not have been filmed.](https://scream.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Prinze) In *Scream 4*, Robbie Mercer isn't gay either. While discussing horror movie tropes with friends, it's said that the only way to be safe in a horror movie is to be gay; later, as the killer threatens him, Robbie desperately claims that he's gay, "if it helps." (It does not help.) The implication is that Robbie is lying in order to avoid being murdered.

Members of the LGBTQ community have been used as villains by Hollywood since before film had sound. If I tried to dive into every movie with a gay, bi, lesbian, or transgender villain, this video would never get finished, so I'm going to focus on a few prominent films that really grabbed the public's attention, starting in 1948 with Alfred Hitchcock's *Rope*. Adapted from the play of the same name, which itself was based on the true story of Leopold and Loeb, a gay couple who, in 1924, murdered a 14-year-old boy just to see if they could get away with it. Spoiler alert: they don't. *Rope* follows Brandon and Phillip, two college students <mark>who murder one of their classmates as an intellectual exercise. They want to prove their superiority over the common man by committing the perfect murder.</mark> The sexual tension between Brandon and Phillip is obvious to anyone with functioning eyes and ears.

Hitchcock, in fact, wanted to see how far he could push the American rating system with the film. The couple's interaction is so intense at times that it’s been compared to watching a sex scene.<sup cn></sup> <mark fc=false>To maintain that, Hitchcock actually shot the film so that it appears to be one long 80-minute take. He did this so that once the film was put before the Hays Code, the then ratings board, they wouldn't be able to really force him to edit any of the movie out, sexual tension or not, without destroying the artistic value of the film.</mark> It's a pretty clever move, really. 

Jimmy Stewart plays Rupert in the movie, the couple’s professor, and joins them for a dinner party, the table of which has been set over a chest containing their victim's body. It's alluded to several times in the film that he is more than just their professor and that he has had a sexual relationship with one, if not both, of our murderers. 

*Rope* is one of Hitchcock's least successful films at the box office, its financial failure being attributed to the gay undertones. It also perpetuated two damaging stereotypes of gay men: that of the dangerous, if not psychotic, homosexual and that of the gay man who thinks he's better than everyone else, the superior. Brandon and Phillip’s assumption that they could get away with murder, even with the victim’s corpse in the same room as a dinner party, shows their belief that homosexuals are superior to heterosexuals. This was a belief amongst straight people at the time. It was a sort of, “Ooh, those gays think they're better than us!” It was especially prevalent in England. I guess they were still sore over the whole Oscar Wilde thing. *Rope* wouldn't be the last time Hitchcock dealt with the LGBT community, though. He did so again in possibly his most famous film.

This is false. I can find no source corroborating this claim.

</comment>
<comment {% include commenter for= tobi %}>

The Wikipedia article notes that Hitchcock did utilize long shots of up to ten minutes and disguised some of the cuts by panning/tracking so that an object would block the entire screen. However, since a reel of film only lasts twenty minutes, the cuts between film reels were deliberately not disguised and Hitchcock would change to a different camera setup. Therefore, the film appears to be five long takes, each 15-20 minutes each, and the last one about 5 minutes.

It was the beginning of the 1960s.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.brightlights_poole at="Context ¶ 1" %}>

Before examining the plot, performances, and technical aspects of *Psycho*, it is important to frame the film in the cultural context of the day. The 1950s is generally regarded as representing the height of achieving the American ideal with an emphasis on conformity.<sup>10</sup> After the Great Depression and World War II, the 1950s became an era of prosperity, and middle-class America emerged and thrived as the market became flooded with goods. There were enough jobs to support the growing consumer appetite, and television brought the idealized image of the American family into many homes as *Ozzie and Harriet* and other shows demonstrated the pleasures of family life. In keeping with enduring Victorian values, sexuality was not discussed. Society, including public schooling, emphasized traditional masculine and feminine roles with men being the family breadwinners and women, even if they worked, being expected to keep their place in the home. Media at the time did not explore alternative sexualities, and even heterosexual married couples were not portrayed as acting sexually. For example, despite being married, Lucy and Desi Arnaz had separate beds on the *I Love Lucy* show, and we never see Ozzie and Harriet or June and Ward Cleaver in the bedroom at all. Sex was off limits except for underground and back-alley publications of “girly” magazines and pulp fiction novels. <mark>A clean, proper image became paramount, with men in suits and women dressed smartly in skirts and blouses, hair coiffed and pearls at the neck.</mark> Diversity was not embraced, as homogeneity was viewed as making society stronger.<sup>11</sup> There were certainly rebels who challenged the zeitgeist of repression and conformity, from Beat novelists like Jack Kerouac to provocative rock and rollers like Elvis Presley. However, these and other such figures were seen as deviant and their work viewed as contributions to the “corruption” that led to 1960s counterculture.

The horrors of World War 2 and the upheaval of the 1960s and 70s seemed a world away in either direction. And into this period of safe white bread suburban heteronormativity came Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho*. The film tells the story of Marion Crane, a secretary that absconds with $40,000 from her employer, her stay at the secluded Bates Motel, and the aftermath. 

*Psycho* is famous for two things: killing its main character halfway through the movie, and the most memorable shower scene this side of the X rating. But Marion Crane isn't the character that people walk away from *Psycho* talking about. It’s Norman Bates, the manager of the Bates Motel, and his extremely unhealthy relationship with his mother. “Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.” 

<mark>Core to the theme of *Psycho* is that a seemingly normal person can harbor many secrets.</mark> Marion's unhappiness with her life, Norman's deeply disturbed nature: both are well hidden from the outside world until they're not.

<mark>Central to the plot of Psycho is the idea that an ordinary person can harbor many secrets,</mark> making his or her appearance seem theatrical. Hall<sup>13</sup> refers to Butler’s concept of identity as performance and, while Hitchcock predates Butler, this notion is very evident in how he directed the development of the central Bloch/Stefano characters in Psycho. Even as the film ends and the murderer is exposed, private conversations within his/her mind conceal what appears to be a disturbed but calm “victim” of faulty psychological development. The opening montage sets the scene for the dark things that take place inside ordinary towns and inside the minds of ordinary people.

Marion meets Norman when escaping from her boring, unhappy life. <mark>A thin but attractive man, Norman is courteous and kind to Marion as he checks her into the motel,</mark> although he shows some odd tendencies, such as his connection with his domineering mother. 

Norman spends most of the film as a sympathetic figure, due mostly to his portrayal by Anthony Perkins, himself a gay actor. Hitchcock was actually aware of Perkins’ homosexuality when he cast him as Norman Bates. Although he wasn't out because it was the 60s, it was well-known around Hollywood, or at least rumored, that Perkins had dated Tab Hunter, a 1950s heartthrob. 

So, when it's revealed at the end of the movie that Norman is not only the killer but also has multiple personalities, the other personality being that of his now-revealed-to-be-dead mother, it was a shock to audiences. And although it's more than obvious that Norman is a madman, many people walked away from *Psycho* looking at Norman as an example of that horrifying group of people they hear about in the cities: those homosexuals and transvestites. A fear that Hollywood spent the next two decades perpetuating with movies like *The Detective*, *Vanishing Point*, *Freebie in the Beam*, and *Dressed to Kill*.

<mark>Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is a thin but attractive figure who is courteous and kind as he assists Marion with an overdue break from her trip.</mark> We discover that he lives with his mother in an ominously large Victorian mansion and that he spends his time caring for the motel that has become all but deserted due to the opening of a new highway. Norman invites Marion to the house to eat, and as she is settling into her room, she hears what seems to be a confrontation between Norman and his mother at the house. Mother is lambasting Norman for inviting a girl into the house and accuses him of violating sexual mores by doing so. In a few moments, Norman appears with a tray of sandwiches, visibly shaken from the run-in with Mother. Marion follows him into the motel’s parlor and, sitting among a sinister collection of stuffed raptors, offers an empathetic ear. It is here in the shadows that we and the birds of prey bear witness to a conversation about internal psychological turmoil, with Marion realizing that she has made a mistake, announcing her return to Phoenix to right her wrong. Norman, however, lets us know that he has been developmentally derailed and that he feels trapped and angry. He says, “We’re all in our private traps. Clamped in them. We scratch and claw, but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it we never budge an inch.” Reading queerly, Norman is making a statement about the impact of cultural expectations on identity. More particularly, he is expressing what Sullivan15 refers to when discussing Cohen’s observation that multiple systems of oppression collide to, “regulate the lives of most people.”<sup>16</sup> Norman’s life has been regulated. He is trapped (like the stuffed birds in the parlor) in a world where he appears to have freedom; however, because of oppressive systems including his own self-regulation, he is anything but free.

After *Cruising* failed to recoup its budget at the box office and the toxic reaction toward the film, Hollywood started to reduce the amount of gay villains in movies, but transgender characters were still open for exploitation. 1983's *Sleepaway Camp*, one of a dozen or so *Friday the 13th* rip-offs, opened on two children, Angela and Peter, boating on a lake with their father and his boyfriend. Okay, cool. But there's an accident, and one of the children dies. Eight years later, we find out that Peter was the child who died, and Angela, now being raised by her Aunt Martha, has become extremely introverted. She, along with some relatives, go to the camp near the lake where the accident occurred, and, in *Friday the 13th* rip-off style, people start turning up dead. But the big twist in the end isn't that it was Jason's mom killing people all along. Instead, we find out that Peter didn't die in the accident.

A copy of the contemporaneous review of *Rope*, from *Harrison's Reports*, can be found [here](https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Harrison%27s_Reports_(1948)_-_Rope), where the film is described as "an exceptionally fine psychological thriller." *Rope* was released in 1948, over 40 years before *Silence of the Lambs* 1991 release. The first use of the term "psychological thriller" that I could find was in a magazine published in 1945, describing a novel called "Crying at the Lock." The term continued to be used throughout the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s in order to describe plays, novels, and films, well before *The Silence of the Lambs*.

*The Silence of the Lambs* is indeed, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film)&oldid=863606000), "the first (and so far only) Best Picture winner widely considered to be a horror film, and only the third such film to be nominated in the category, after *The Exorcist* (1973) and *Jaws* (1975)."

In both the novel and film, Buffalo Bill, whose real name is Jame Gumb, is portrayed as something close to a transgender person, at least on the surface. He appears to want to be a woman, creating a bodysuit out of the flesh of his victims, but as it’s stated in both the film and book, he is not transgender. Hannibal Lecter says,

Gumb is certainly a deranged character and is, in the very least, bisexual, having been in a relationship with one of Hannibal's male patients as well as women in the past, but his identity as a transgender character is far more questionable. He has a self-loathing that is well beyond anything typical. His own self-hatred drives him to want to be something else, anything else, than what he actually is. Although he's likely more gay than bisexual, he has an obsession with women stemming from his mother abandoning him as a child. He would eventually find out that she was an alcoholic prostitute but went on to create a beauty queen image of his mother in his head, the perfect woman, a woman that anyone would want to be, including him. Buffalo Bill was not a transgender individual but, as Lecter said, he wanted to be. He applied for gender reassignment surgery at multiple hospitals but was universally declined because of his mental state. Despite what Republicans think, you can't just get a sex change. There's a massive amount of psychological testing before doctors will move forward with the procedure, <mark>especially in the case of male-to-female gender confirmation.</mark> So, when Bill was denied this procedure, he decided to make himself into a woman any way he could.

There was massive backlash against the film upon release, as the LGBT community accused the movie of both transphobia and homophobia. The director, Jonathan Demme, did his best to defend the film, but most people still look at it as a piece of overtly anti-LGBT cinema. Although it was stated very clearly that from a psychological perspective, Buffalo Bill is not a transgender person, it's still a thorny situation. Bill's gender identity is only commented on by cisgender people in the book and film, and so cisgender people are in essence deciding whether or not a person is transgender. Trans activists argued that if Buffalo Bill thinks he is transgender, then he is, and it's not the place of the cisgender characters to decide. Which would mean that Bill is a terrible representation of transgender women, who, for the most part, are very passive and nonviolent. In fact, trans women are infinitely more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than the perpetrator of one, and therefore, the argument that *Silence of the Lambs* is a transphobic film holds some weight. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.sociological_cinema at="¶ 5" %}>

In addition to crazed killers, *Silence of the Lambs* portrays transgender women as imposters. After analyzing the Buffalo Bill case files, Hannibal Lecter muses, “Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual, but his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.” This quote enforces the idea that other people can determine a person’s gender identity. Although Jame Gumb was a ruthless murderer who skinned people alive, if she identified as a woman, she was a woman. If a person thinks they are transgender, they are. In real life, transgender people’s identities are often scrutinized by cisgender people. There is a fascination with the genitals of transgender people, based upon the erroneous idea that one’s sexual organs determine gender. In a recent interview with Orange is the New Black actress Laverne Cox and RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant Carmen Carrera, Katie Couric asked Carrera, “Your private parts are different now, aren’t they?” This display of cisgender privilege (a cisgender actress would never be asked about her genitals) threatened to derail an otherwise constructive discussion about gender. Ultimately, the condition of Carrera’s genitalia bears no relation to her womanhood.

Regarding this type of transgender character in fiction, LGBT activist Savannah Stobbs said, <q>“Transgender women are often represented as psychotic killers as a lazy method of responding to mainstream society's fear of gender nonconforming people. This popular trope in film reinforces the idea that being transgender is unnatural and perverted, and pathologizes gender fluidity." 

But on the other hand, with Buffalo Bill being so obviously insane, can his own feelings about his gender identity be valid? He is detached from reality, and in the book, it is stated quite clearly that even if he had gotten the gender confirmation surgery, he would have eventually found a different reason to at least harm people, if not outright kill them, because he is psychotic, unhinged. His gender identity has nothing to do with that.

Jame Gumb’s gender identity is handled in a number of very problematic ways. First, her character is a classic example of the killer transgender trope, also famously present in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. Transgender women are often represented as psychotic killers as a lazy method of responding to mainstream society’s fear of gender nonconforming people. This popular trope in film reinforces the idea that being transgender is unnatural and perverted, and pathologizes gender fluidity.

Transgender people are frequently demeaned, misgendered, and denied healthcare because they are regarded as "insane." Some transphobes argue that the very act of identifying as a different gender makes one insane. Others say that people with mental illness cannot possibly make such a major decision for themselves. Autistic people especially are targeted in this manner. Transgender people who are in prison, at least in the United States, are also often denied gender affirming healthcare, not to mention safe accomodations.

In the book, it is noted by a specialist who saw Bill about the gender confirmation surgery that he did not present any of the characteristics of a transgender woman, furthering the argument, in the fiction at least, that he is not transgender. And of course, Buffalo Bill is not a real person. He is a character created by an author and then interpreted by filmmakers. Thomas Harris did not write a transgender character but an extremely psychologically disturbed one, a character with a horrifying childhood, lifelong emotional instability, and violent tendencies. A psychopathic character that hates himself so much that he's willing to torture, kill, and fillet women to be someone else. There could be a debate to be had whether or not Buffalo Bill is a transgender character, but the most important thing might be how his character was perceived by audiences, and many audiences did see him as a transgender character. Buffalo Bill’s presence can still be felt today in bathroom laws across the United States and in the fearmongering of right-wing conservatives. Buffalo Bill has even been mentioned by Fox News commentators when trying to defend the discriminatory bathroom laws, <mark fc=false>with some Republicans even nicknaming North Carolina's bathroom law HB 2 “the Buffalo Bill.”</mark> So, even though Thomas Harris and Jonathan Demme did not intend for Bill to be a trans character, he is now ingrained in the public consciousness as the worst possible example of the transgender community. A highly unrealistic one.

LGBT villains would remain a staple in Hollywood films for years to come. The bisexual Catherine Tramell in 1992’s *Basic Instinct* drew the ire of lesbian and bisexual groups especially, pointing out how bisexuals had minimal, if any, representation in mainstream media and how the biggest bisexual character was a murderous, narcissistic psychopath. But where *Cruising*, which did portray some LGBT characters as human and sympathetic, failed at the box office, *Basic Instinct* portrayed a murderous bisexual woman and was box office gold, taking in three hundred and fifty million dollars in 1992. That's over half a billion dollars when you adjust it for inflation. Hollywood brought out the bisexual villains several more times in the 1990s, most notably in *The Talented Mr. Ripley* in 1999, but none of them had quite as much success as *Basic Instinct*.

So, as you can see, the LGBT community has been fodder for Hollywood's villain machine for almost a century. We can be portrayed as the terrifying other, the corrupted city dwellers that the suburbanites have fled from. But Hollywood itself has strayed away from portraying gay characters as villains in more recent years. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Buffalo Bill in a cinema near you in 2018. In fact, there's another remake of *Psycho* in the works, and they've already said that Norman will not be dressing as his mother in this version. So, things have gotten better. Mainstream media no longer portrays us as monsters. Teenage girls and their moms were the biggest audience for this year's *Love, Simon*. But with GLAAD’s 2018 survey of LGBT representation in cinema showing that our percentage of representation on the big screen is lower now than it has been in over a decade, maybe we need to ask the question, is no representation better than bad representation?

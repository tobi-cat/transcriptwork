There has arguably never been a human civilization in history that did not exist under the threat of vampires. In a universal context they represent our fears of not only death but unrest in death. Though it's one of those “a rose by any other name” kind of things where monsters we may anthropologically recognize as vampires were not the sexy, murderous or twinkly vampires we know of today. Proto-vampires of the ancient world had any range of characteristics and creation stories, some proto-vampires being blessed or cursed by gods or hearkened to fears of the unburied dead. Especially looking toward peoples in East Asia and the indigenous people of Australia and the Americas, there was almost always some kind of creature or monster which combined elements of undeath, the consumption of the living and the shunning of the sun. 

</james>
<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

When we observe historic vampires, we observe the fear and what the fear was usually meant to indicate. Usually vampiric fables served the utility of spooking a society into proper burial rites, and to avoid cannibalism. Being unable to walk in sunlight, though, that was probably more of a symbolic gesture. Light, specifically the sun, in almost all pre-Christian and pre-colonial societies represented the highest good or capital-T Truth. Sun gods were usually the highest deity in a given pantheon. The ancients very quickly recognized that, especially in the context of agriculture, the sun is kind of important for almost everything, and so by the power of the sun, ancient gods allowed those great civilizations to flourish, so that what was outside of the realm of what the gods considered holy was associated with darkness. The proto-vampire and by extension the vampire proper was shunned from the sun because they either represented something the public could recognize as evil or because they had by action or accident done something to earn the gods’ rejection.

Some gods also preferred to keep their followers in the dark, however. Take, for instance, the goddess Hecate.<sup cn>*</sup> She was an addition to the Hellenic pantheon from Indo-European migrants, and in spite of the fact that her domain of magic and the moon were already covered by Artemis and Selene, she became a permanent fixture and was even translated into the Roman goddess Trivia. Goddesses of the dark were usually tied to the moon, an indication that even in the night there remained a holy light from an alternative source. Hecate's distinction was that she was more closely associated with the rustic gods than the proper Olympians, closely associated with the god Pan as occasionally a maternal figure. That said, Hecate enjoyed widespread and prominent urban worship, particularly in Athens. Really interesting goddess for both her role in the pantheon but as well as the historic movements of her myths across the Mediterranean. She also had a cult of witches who ate dead babies, allegedly. 

<footer><sup cn>*</sup> Mispronounced as "Heck-ate"</footer>
</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It should be no surprise that in Hellenic myth, Hecate's daughter Empusa was a bronze-legged vampire who fed on the blood of men she would seduce. The particular fear hearkens to ancient Greece’s repulsion of a powerful independent woman. This also applies to the Witches of Thessaly… the baby munchers. Of course any woman who seeks power outside the institutional misogyny of ancient Hellas will be accused of heinous acts. Meanwhile, the first female presidential nominee from a major political party was also accused of eating babies. It's been 5,000 years, guys, get something original. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This isn't to say that the Empusai are the sole progenitors of vampires, but the impact that a bunch of pagan homosexuals had on shaping subsequent millennia of Christian European culture is immeasurable. It's remarkable just how much of the Empusai is recognizable in Victorian depictions of vampires. That said, the values were slightly shifted. Whereas the gothic writers of Europe focused on depicting nocturnal predators, the ancients downplayed this next to “please don't have sex with dead things.” The monotheistic colonization of Europe and Africa removed competing gods, and with the God of Abraham, the sole deity, coming to a parallel association with the sun, Europe found itself without any divine protection in the night such as moon gods. Imagery around the Christian God is so quintessentially tied to sunlight that he may as well have been seen as a sun god himself, which is also weird because by Catholic doctrine he is also a triple deity. For which triple deities were predominantly women including Hecate herself and the Morrigan, who were both associated with magic -- magic, which is considered unholy because of its association with the moon. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Anyway, within Christian literature there is a strong connection between God and the light of day. Look to <mark fc=false>The Faerie Queene, a staple of formative English literature, published in 1590, and indicative of the Norman re-evaluation of English mythological sensibilities, away from the Norse and Germanic roots of the Anglo-Saxons, replacing it with a mythological cycle that is more traditionally French.</mark> This text makes frequent allusions to light and darkness. Dark forests and wilderness is where the heroic Red Cross finds denizens that are malevolent and who reject God. And these denizens may challenge his chivalry, or tempt him away from God's grace, or to Catholicism which according to the Anglicans was evil. And while this isn't really about vampires, it does exemplify the Christian affinity for holding that the unholy is that which exists without God's light. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=lvence %}>

The Norman conquest happened 5 whole centuries before Spenser ever wrote the Faerie Queene. Most scholars interpret the poem as about Ireland, [this source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171728?seq=14) says the themes of the story are Celtic. Also wouldn't Spenser’s influence be other Renaissance poets like Tasso?

</comment>
<james span=2 {% include timecode %}>

But this does apply to vampires in a more European context, for which our analysis shifts from the proto-vampires that can be identified in most historic cultures to the creatures that come to mind with the word “vampire.” Europe's Christianization brought about a closer association between the nighttime and the monsters of all kinds, for which even the Arcadian origins of the werewolf were used to taint the cycles of the moon. The vampire's distance from the literal object of sunlight, representing the figurative element of God's light, was a method for European communities and leaders to indirectly, though very clearly, articulate what values they wanted to highlight as evil. 

Just as the ancient Greeks wanted to instill a culture with fear of a woman seductress by plainly associating her with the demonic urge to eat babies, the European vampire’s predatory nature, and relegation to the shadows which were inaccessible to God, was a free license to associate all things outside of the social norm and connect it with evil. It's like McCarthy-era “How to Spot a Communist” instructional videos. <mark fc=false>The villagers of Europe would keep an eye on their lords and neighbors, and cautionary fables of the vampire would help them identify deviant behavior which they would then report to their local parish.</mark> Snitching! It's in white people's DNA. 

</james>
<from></from>
<comment {% include commenter for=lvence %}>

Source? The modern vampire originated in Southeastern Europe, so why would this happen in the entire continent? [Further research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_folklore_by_region) revealed the 18th century Vampire hysteria, but again it had nothing to do with snitching and instead on desecration of corpses to prevent vampirism.

<james {% include timecode %}>

The vampire became a method of exploring these provocative desires in a coded fashion. However, true to the Hays Code resemblances, these desires had to be expressed in line with contemporary European values of the day. The monster, the sexual deviant, must be brutalized. It's no surprise that many vampires are found out due to their lurid sexual overtones, especially as they became increasingly connected to a kind of extravagant sexual predator who exists in opulence and lavishness. Vampires came to represent the urban predator, compared to the werewolves and ghosts of the countryside. So naturally vampires are, from an anthropological viewpoint, an excellent symbol of a society's collective fears of who exactly is an “other.” For the Hellenics, it was the single ladies. Within the public circles of the 1700s and onwards, regardless of what was going on in the manners of the wealthy, there was an intense public fear of sexuality, and as would develop throughout the 1800s, an intense push for conformity to heteronormative sexual standards and gender roles, which was when the vampire had its greatest heyday in storytelling and became a staple of Gothic literature and folklore alike – at least until now.

## Part One – You’re Dead

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Somehow we ended up with *What We Do in the Shadows*. Well, the series, which is what is under discussion today, was originally a companion spin-off to the New Zealand independent film by Taiko Waititi. It has likely since eclipsed the original context, both in the range of side characters, settings and world-building, but also in terms of how strongly this improv-based comedy series has endured five seasons without any sign of slowing down. But what makes this series so important to vampires like me?  Well, sure, it plays off a bunch of vampire aesthetics and traits which point out how incoherent the collective vampire mythos is. Somehow it all finds a way into this comedic parody, and the absurdity of it all just adds to the comedy, making these real people who are bound by certain vampiric rules. 

</james>
<from></from>

Nadja: Do you think maybe you could let me into your shelter of automobiles? 

Garage attendant: What? Oh yeah, come on in, of course.

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And yes, as the series goes on, it's been confirmed that each one of the main characters is some variant and intensity of queer. Not that it really needed to be confirmed, but it's nice to have these outspoken queer characters, who are queer without being preachy. 

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Guillermo: Nadja, make sure that they remember the part about me telling them that I'm gay, so…

Nadja: I mean, who isn't gay? 

Guillermo: A lot of people. 

Nadja: Oh, okay, woo-hoo. I'll get the trumpets out, sorry. 

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

However, *What We Do* vampires marks a titular turning point in how our culture has come to understand vampires, a precipice that has been thousands of years in the making, and this comes down to how the show frames and displays these vampires. The series is a documentary-style comedy featuring frequent cutaways, confessional segments where the vampires address the audience directly in order to offer additional elaboration on either elements of the show or how the history of vampiric folklore manifests in the modern day. 

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Nadja: Half the bats you see, they are just vampires that have thrown terrible orgies and they are too ashamed to regain their vampire form so they just flit around. Shame bats. Bats full of shame.

<james {% include timecode %}>

The general premise of the show is a little bit more lax than the movie. The series does have the overarching plotline of Guillermo saying, “Can I haz vampire?” Aside from that, the show is about a collection of roommates who are struggling with the dregs of eternal life in modern America. Each of these roommates can be seen as a typification of the various subgenres of vampires, with a couple of recurring characters filling in the gaps. The comedic sensibilities come from a gross defamiliarization and demystification of the vampire myth itself. What do we do in the shadows? More or less what normal people do, but with a dash of chaotic anachronism.

Nandor: I was just checking my email, I didn't know it would be full of curses. 

Laszlo: All we need to do is send that to 10 friends or foes by sunrise and the curse will be lifted.

Nadja: Where are we going to get the email addresses, the email address shop?!

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

First, there's Nandor who is indicative of the kind of Vlad Tepes vampire -- which, though he may have been a distant inspiration for Count Dracula, reconnecting Dracula to the warrior mythology wasn't something that would be done until Francis Ford Coppola’s incredibly faithful retelling of the story. Nandor the Relentless is a former warlord of the fictional nation of Al-Quolanudar. Kayvan Novak’s portrayal of an Impaler-inspired vampire becomes a commentary on the kind of person who peaked at seventeen when he scored a winning touchdown and took his team to state. Knowing that he can't relive the glory days, he struggles to find ways to feel meaningful. He knows he wants to do something important, but he doesn't really know what that is or how to apply himself to the modern world. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In order of who the gays are in a frenzy over, there's Nadja. Natasia Demetriou takes on a more generalized take on the vampire queen, perhaps most clearly drawing from the vampirus progenitor Carmilla. “Nadja” is also the title of the 1994 horror film about the daughter of Count Dracula. FYI, the more you know. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This is not that Nadja though, who was born in an impoverished village on the Greek island of Antipaxos. Nadja is driven, ambitious, capable and strongly indicated to be the most rawly powerful vampire in the household, fearing only her sire, the Baron Afanas. Darth Vader doesn't have shit on her. While Nadja initially plays into to the “competent women among male idiots” trope, it's made abundantly clear that she doesn't have her shit together at all either, in the slightest, and is far more dependent on her idiots then she lets on. Demetriou balances Nadja's incredible strength with the exact kind of character flaws that most A-type personalities suffer from: being a complete hot fucking mess. 

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Nadja: Something is going very tits up with my life!

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

A third housemate is playing off a lesser known vampiric tale, the psychic vampire. Colin Robinson, as such a vampire, feeds off of the life energy of someone. Rather than waving his hands and using magic to drain their life from someone, Colin Robinson feeds off of their heightened emotions, or just general annoyance. He goes about talking about random information dumps that are tangentially related to the topic at hand, or by doing naturally irritating things. Colin Robinson seems to be a one-note character at first from his introduction, though the show makes quick work of highlighting just the level of absurdity that this character offers to the show. Less an allegory of an actual kind of vampire and moreso a comedic play about a certain kind of person. 

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Colin: TGIF! It's 5:00 somewhere! Daaaan. Working hard or hardly working? 

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

…We all know one. If you know more than two Canadians, chances are you know an energy vampire. Who do you think runs the Parliament? Colin Robinson is a sheer contrast to normal vampires like me who pride themselves on how interesting they are. To a psychic vampire, being interesting is detrimental to their ability to feed. 

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Colin: Says here that I am 100% white.

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Colin Robinson is gray and beige, preferring cardigans and sweater vests where the others don extravagant gowns, lavish multi-piece suit ensembles and surcoats. However it's Nadja’s husband who is worth discussion for this context. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Laszlo Cravensworth. He is probably the most memeable character of the show, if for no other reason than some very strategic line deliveries. It took everyone a few episodes to really get going, but Matt Berry showed up on set and had his character locked and loaded from the very beginning. 

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Laszlo: The only hairy frog I'm interested in, my darling, is the one between your legs. 

Nadja: It's not just a frog, it's the whole swamp. 

Laszlo: True!

</clip>
<james span=2 {% include timecode %}>

If Nandor is indicative of a vampiric folk tale of a reclusive cruel baron, and Nadja is the Victorian vampiric seductress, Laszlo is a satirical reflection of a vampire of the late 20th century, capturing the raw excessive sensuality of Anne Rice's vampires and those who she later inspired -- but not the sparkly ones! Laszlo has an extreme comfort around sex that would <mark fc stat:id="malaprop">shock the public facade</mark> of any British lawmaker of the 1800s or today. Granted, for their day job they'd conveniently forget about the sexual depravity that took part in the West End. 

</james>
<from></from>
<comment {% include commenter for=kenm %}>

You don’t shock a facade.

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The other vampires have their ambitions and objectives and grand designs. Laszlo by contrast seems entirely content with where he is, perfectly happy to spend his days engaging not only in lurid acts of varying intensities but bearing no discrimination to any of it. He also partakes in any manner of art and culture. 

Granted, all the vampires are very open about their sexuality and sexual attractions…

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.whatWeDo %}>

Nandor: So some of my wives were girl wives, some of them were guy wives. It's not that different.

<james {% include timecode %}>

…Laszlo is the sexual deviant the Victorians feared so deeply. Meanwhile, he's the most harmless of the group, the most likely to form human friendships and who seems to have the lowest body count, save for Colin Robinson who does not need to kill his victims to feed off of them (though death might be preferable). In fact, the ensemble of characters, and the fact that it's popular enough to assume that the largest swath of the public gets it, seems to indicate a shift, not towards how we think of vampires as a culture, but a shift in our very culture itself. Vampires, which were once decried as monsters to whom social deviance was compared to a kind of cosmic treason against the light of God, are now accepted as people with whom many of us could see ourselves being friendly. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Regardless, What We Do in the Shadows seems to represent a most recent step in our society’s dissemination of vampires, and not only what they mean to us but to gauge the moral value that is placed on the values that vampires represent. However, with What We Do in the Shadows seeming to typify so many vampire tropes and reflect upon us our shifting evolution on the evaluation of these social elements, did these progenitors actually carry this weight and what were exactly the original progenitors of these roommates? To understand what these vampires represent to our society, we first need to understand what those vampires meant to theirs.

## Part Two: Lady Killers

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The vampire enjoyed a period of relative anonymity between antiquity and the Industrial Revolution. Being creatures tied to pagan deities, they fell to the wayside in lieu of more generalized revenant zombies. However, there were a large number of reported vampire sightings in the 1700s coming from the area of the Balkan Peninsula. It's difficult to really gauge what vampires meant to pre-baroque Europeans because the bulk of European fears were attached to witchcraft. Maybe Hecate and her single ladies weren't on sabbatical after all. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

However, in light of superstition migrating across Europe with a flood of Eastern European immigrants, vampires very suddenly and very quickly took the common folk by the throat. At the time, there was a dualistic fascination with Slavic culture that came in tandem with the fear of those foreign values passing into proper European society, coupled of course with a very Victorian fear of what they described as social decay, whatever that meant. Something about foundational European values being abandoned for radical new ideas, which may have been at the time code for being afraid of immigrants, but England has surely shaken off that by now! Because the Americas are any better. And you know, in light of that perhaps the reason white people are so terrified of immigrant cultures quote-unquote “invading” is because we subconsciously are aware that it's exactly what we white people did when we “immigrated” to America. Maybe. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

At any rate, in perhaps in line with this “social decay” was a growing trend of rock star poets who wanted to write about sex but still wanted to keep up airs of being a respectable gentleman. In order to avert censorship and scandal, they wrote this subject of sexual fascination into their villains. It's nothing short of hypocritical that Lord Byron wrote of a vampiric villain who fed on blood and chastity. Coincidental of course that he himself was likened to a vampire, by one of his gay exes no less. While the vampire existed in poetry before then, Lord Byron's… former… personal physician John Polidori published a short work of prose fiction in 1819 called “The Vampyre,” with a Y. Which also, looking into it, there was like twelve poems called “The Vampyre” before then. Polidori was just the first to set it to prose, and the first which specifically painted the vampire as making his hunting ground out to be the social elite by masquerading as one of them himself. 

No longer semi-demonic cave dwellers roving the countryside nor the reclusive occupants of seemingly deserted manors and forts, there was only a brief transition between the vampire of Southeastern Europe and the high-rolling ladykiller of Polidori. Polodori’s vampire is Lord Ruthven, whose reputation in English high society warrants caution, though the novel's protagonist John -- I mean, Aubrey -- instigates<sup stat:id="malaprop" class="add">[sic: ingratiates]</sup> himself with him nevertheless. Aubrey is drawn to ruin on an almost supernatural level. And while he never is particularly threatened by Ruthven, he overlooks an apparent darkness. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Ruthven and Aubrey go on a tour of Europe, as was a common coming-of-age ritual for young affluent men of the day, much in the same way that Polidori and Byron found themselves in a cottage on Lake Geneva with Mary and Percy Shelley, a famous late-spring trip which is cited as being the conception for Frankenstein. Granted, the same-sex attraction between Ruthven and Aubrey is… subtext… but not really. Polidori had to be careful not to out himself publicly or he would suffer the same backlash that Byron often received. Granted, this was a day and age where sexual perversion of all kinds, including gross heterosexual promiscuity, was on the same level as buggery. Provided more research, I would like to see if people of the day just took it for granted that a vampire, provided promiscuity, would also imply an extension of sexual appetites to same-sex desire. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

As a piece of evidence, look to another and perhaps more significant work of vampiric fiction, *Carmilla*, by Irish author Sheridan Le Fanu. Unlike Polidori, there isn't really any information to suggest that Le Fanu engaged in queerness in his own personal life, though his expression of same-sex desire among women is more stark than among Carmilla’s vam-peers. There may be a few reasons for this inclusion. Perhaps because it was European custom to tolerate close if not intimate friendships between women. Alternatively because, in line with an ‘80s slasher movie reserving the most brutal deaths for those committing premarital sex, Carmilla herself is brutalized in a way that was not reserved for any vampires until Breaking Dawn – Part 2.

While it can be said that the work is sympathetic to queer people and that queerness itself is not the element that is punished, it can alternately be observed that punishment is reserved for the sexual aggressor in order to protect Laura, who represents the naive delicate feminine sensibilities that the Victorians praised so much.

Carmilla, Lucy Westenra, and the brides of Dracula are threats to heteronormativity because in one body they simultaneously contain and refuse all hetero desires. The female vampire encompasses “ideals of femininity, such as fragility, strength, beauty, and power,” and she “engag[es] in symbolic connections between blood and female sexuality” (Hobson 9). At the same time, she is hyper sexualized and has “bestial qualities by puncturing...with elongating fangs...” (Hammack 887). <mark>The female vampire is the ultimate predator and</mark> <mark>challenger of the patriarchal system</mark> because of <mark>her desirability</mark>, her threat <mark>to penetrate her male victims</mark>, and her threat to eat her children. <mark>But Carmilla works differently than the female vampires of Dracula.</mark> <mark>Carmilla does not desire men.</mark>

<mark v>When the vampire is a lesbian, she</mark> <mark>becomes “the destroyer of other women and undermines heteronormative masculine power”</mark> (Hobson 11). Carmilla performs this function by corrupting the bonds of friendship she forms with the protagonist Laura. The corruption of this friendship is important because “romantic friendships between women—which may or may not have been sexual—were socially sanctioned” (Faderman 240), but if evidence of lesbianism should surface the women were punished because lesbian desires “illustrate the concerns … about unproductive and degenerate sexuality” (Hobson 12). When Laura meets Carmilla, the two of them find they have much in common: both are lonely, both are missing a parent, both belong to wealthy families, both are the same age, and both dreamed about the other when she was six years old and in the dream the other was the age they are presently. Lesbian undertones color Laura’s dream and foreshadow what lies ahead. In Laura’s dream, Carmilla creeps into Laura’s room and bites her on the breast. Carmilla begins to flirt with Laura after they first meet, saying, “If you were less pretty I think I should be very much afraid of you” and Laura’s feels “drawn towards her…but there was also something of repulsion.” Despite the repulsion, Laura likes Carmilla and how she is “determined that we should be very near friends” (LeFanu 17-18).

<mark>Carmilla poses the biggest threat to heteronormativity because of her desire for other women and her refusal of patriarchal power structure</mark>; therefore she suffers the most horrifying and total destruction of any vampire to this point in literary history. Carmilla’s history and true identity is uncovered when Laura and Carmilla are separated on an outing to the local ruins. Laura’s party get to the ruins first and they discover General Spielsdorf, a friend of Laura’s father, there looking for the grave of Millarca Karstein, the vampire who killed his niece. Once Laura and her family hear Spielsdorf’s tale to its conclusion, Carmilla walks in. The General recognizes her as the same Millarca that killed his niece. He tries to kill Carmilla with an axe, but in a show of superhuman strength (one of the few constants of the vampire archetype) Carmilla catches the axe, shatters the handle, and flees the scene. Carmilla’s grave is soon discovered. The next day Laura’s father, the General, and two doctors open Carmilla’s grave and officially examine her sleeping body and determine that she is a vampire.

But where Stoker restores “balance” to his novel with the male led heteronormative society decidedly the victors, LeFanu does not afford his readers the same ease. At the end of the novella, Laura can still hear “the light step of Carmilla” (72).

The link between vampires and queerness was related seemingly insofar as vampires represented all manner of sexual deviants, though I can't help, given the volume of queer writers who seem to be drawn to the vampire, thinking that, even if just to read their exes, perhaps there is something more to this. I question whether there was a portion of the vampiric mythos that functioned as a beacon, as if by some kind of code, vampires were symbols that non-conformists could signal to one another. Through their public masquerade as monsters, others within society who themselves were often compared to monsters could be drawn towards like-minded spaces, and through the squall of homophobic and quite frankly sex-phobic social conditioning, the presence of this violent myth presented a gateway for the imprudent to seek out one another. Among the most significant elements of this pattern actually occurred in 1976.

Anne Rice’s vamps are pivotal for representing a shift in vampiric perspectives. This new vampire Louis sat down for an interview once upon a time and changed how we all thought of vampires forever. While vampires had been sexual, Anne Rice was among the first to make them sexy. While Interview with the Vampire was not an initial success, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro’s Saint-Germain series of Central Romance Books began in 1978 and endured until 2014.

…I guess?! Rice's vampires specifically stood out because of her focus on their beauty, specifically Lestat’s. <mark>Indeed when we first encounter Lestat through the fevered lens of Louis who's very depressed, his depiction bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura’s portrayal of Carmilla. Lestat is described as fair-skinned, possessing a graceful, almost feline quality in his movements, and he's even likened to an angel</mark>, a far cry from the beings distant from God's light. Though granted, the vampire had been <span stat:id="malaprop">renowned<sup class="add">[sic: known]</sup></span> to shroud itself in a curtain of perceived piety.

Another departure from vampiric traditionalism is Rice's <span stat:id="malaprop">insistence<sup class="add">[sic: depiction]</sup></span> on the ritual to become a vampire. <mark>No longer can a vampire just bite you and turn you into one.</mark> Quite frankly, it was never quite that clear when a vampire bit to kill and when to spread the curse, it was all very confusing. <mark>With Rice, the vampiric candidate must participate in the ritual by consuming the blood of their sire</mark>, and while this speaks to a kind of mandate for reciprocal consent, it fits better with the Victorian perspective on the curse. An individual who is forced into vampirism is tragic and <span stat:id="malaprop">empathetic<sup class="add">[sic: sympathetic]</sup></span>, though depicting each vampire as an active participant in their own downfall is what you get the tortures and pitchforks for. Some poetic justice. 

And make no mistake, Rice makes a point of <span stat:id="malaprop">exemplifying<sup class="add">[sic: emphasizing]</sup></span> that vampires without a pulse cannot develop an erection. <mark>However, feeding on one another is unmistakably depicted as a sex act. During the titular interview, Louis recounts, “I drank, sucking the blood out of the wounds, experiencing for the first time since infancy the unique pleasure of drawing nourishment, the body wholly attuned to the mind's focus on a single, vital source.”</mark> Oh yes, normal fellatio things. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.jon_tyler_thesis at="p30-31" %}>

Rice sets up Interview to be a queer text from its beginning. After Louis Pointe du Lac’s brother dies from an accidental fall down the stairs, Louis moves with his mother and sister from their plantation to the city of New Orleans. Louis begins to seek death by getting drunk and getting into fights. Louis feels responsible for his brother’s death because they were fighting before his brother’s fatal fall. One night he is attacked by a vampire and drained nearly to the point of death. He is found and led back to his house where he takes fever and is put on bed rest. One night the vampire who drained him reappears. <mark>The physical descriptions of Lestat is the first time a male vampire has been described in terms of beauty-- in fact, Lestat’s description, given by the fevered Louis, mirrors Laura’s description of Carmilla. Lestat is “fair-skinned” with a “graceful, almost feline quality to his movements” and is also compared to an angel</mark> (13, 17). Lestat’s feminization continues when he turns Louis into a vampire. <mark>The vampire bite alone is not enough to turn one into a vampire.</mark> <mark>Louis has to drink Lestat’s blood.</mark> <mark>So to become a vampire one has to perform two same-sex sex acts. Louis tells the interviewer, “I drank, sucking the blood out of the holes, experiencing for the first time since infancy the special pleasure of sucking nourishment, the body focused with the mind upon one vital source”</mark>(20). These acts make Lestat Louis’ father and mother, and Lestat is both male and female, aggressor and nourisher. The transformation is complete by the end of the night. But Lestat did not prepare. Louis has no coffin in which to sleep and is forced to share one with Lestat. The act here continues the homoerotic tone, but it is more an act of necessity than desire.

<mark>This immortal sanguinary duo is intriguingly queer, identifying as such, and their interactions are not just charged but are undeniably intense, passionate and occasionally interspersed with the crimson fluid of life.</mark> <mark>Their existence beyond their vampiric thirst challenges the very fabric of human convention.</mark> 

<mark>Interview gracefully dances through a profound narrative, intertwining the complexities of sexuality, race, identity, dominance and societal suppression.</mark> <mark>Through this lens it underscores the history of America and the constraints it has placed on these magnificently queer vampires, forcing them into a dance of audacious queerness and a myriad of misdeeds.</mark>

<mark>AMC’s *Interview with the Vampire*, an updated, grisly, and often mordantly hilarious retelling of the original story pulls gay subtext into the main text</mark>, <mark>giving us a fancy vampire looking for a longtime companion.</mark> <mark>When Lestat de Lioncourt (Sam Reid) tells Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) that he’s seeking an eternal partner, it’s very clear that he’s not looking for a roommate.</mark>

<mark>The immortal, bloodsucking, male pair in the show are queer as in they not only identify as LGBTQ, but also have a lot of extremely steamy, sometimes bloody,</mark> highly detailed sex with each other, other men, and occasionally some women. <mark>They’re also queer in that they are living lives, aside from just the undead bloodlust, in opposition to human norms.</mark>

<mark>And in telling their story, Interview creates an emboldened commentary about how sexuality, race, identity, power, and oppression are all intertwined</mark>, <mark>and how these forces have throughout American history left these magnificently queer vampires (and many others) with no choice but to be extremely gay and do so, so many crimes.</mark>

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<mark>In a way, the concept of gay vampires is intellectually appetizing.</mark> <mark x>With eons at their disposal, surely these immortal beings would indulge, experiment and embrace the fluidity of their desires.</mark> <mark>Lestat in his grandeur perceives vampires as beings transcendent of mere humans. Consequently, they are unfettered by the petty prejudices and insecurities that plague mankind. To them, concepts like racism, sexism and homophobia are trivial, for humanity itself is deemed inconsequential.</mark> 

<mark>As a mortal, Louis's queer identity, albeit concealed, combined with being black in a very racist America, relegates him to society's periphery. Lestat, with his telepathic lamentations, frequently underscores the ignorance and inelegance of racist humans who demean Louis for the color of his skin. To Lestat, the real grotesquery lies within typical men.</mark> <mark x>In the realm of the undead, Louis is unshackled from mankind’s oppressive decrees,</mark> no longer ensnared by societal bindings and racist overtones of the era. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.vox_article at="¶ 8-12" %}>

<mark>Logically, gay vampires make a ton of sense.</mark> <mark x>Vampires are immortal, able to live for centuries, maybe a millennium and longer if they don’t run out of food and don’t run into a slayer. Theoretically, that would give them ample time to experiment and, if the spirit moved them, be extremely free with their sexuality.</mark>

<mark>Vampires, as Lestat demonstrates, see themselves as superior to humans. And thus, they don’t abide by the same set of cultural norms that exist for humankind. Vampires don’t partake in racism, sexism, and homophobia because all of humanity is beneath them, let alone humanity’s awful hangups.</mark>

<mark>Louis, a queer Black man in the 1910s, feels the full force of that bigotry. Thus, a huge part of Lestat’s undead sell to Louis are telepathic complaints about how stupid and ugly racist humans are, and how these dim creatures treat Louis less-than because of the color of his skin. To Lestat, humans are the monsters.</mark>

Vampires have lived long enough and in enough places that they can easily spot humanity’s big oopsies. The caveat to vampiric superiority, of course, is that if vampires want an eternal partner, they have to go into the minor leagues and find a human acceptable enough to turn into a vampire. But vampires probably, as Lestat also demonstrates, aren’t going to let racism or homophobia guide their desire.

Dracula. 

No, this wasn't an omission because it's been done and analyzed to death, but tracking the progress and development of vampires in the last 200 years as per the extra-canonical depictions of the Count, particularly in the context of whether or not they're serving gothussy – Bat-pussy is just.. bussy – is something we can do here, because for all the plethora of versions of Dracula, several of these variations penned by Bram Stoker himself, Francis Ford Coppola’s Bram Stoker's Dracula (henceforth referred to as Coppola’s Dracula to avoid confusion) was a unique… furry awakening -- I mean, a unique sensual depiction of this titular Transylvanian recluse. Even in the book, Dracula is never as explicitly seductive as he is with Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder eye-fucking each other on the Victorian streets of England. Bram Stoker himself was arguably gay, and the figure of Dracula was inspired by an emotionally distant employer of his, and while it is widely accepted that there is an abundance of subtext to be read into the exchanges of Jonathan Harker and Count Dracula, the film does not elaborate on them, mostly.

Fun fact -- that was improvised. Gary Oldman was chronically sauced on set, and it was scripted that Dracula had cut Harker. Gary just went and licked it up, and ended up slicing his tongue open in the process. Meanwhile, that's the most unsettling shot in the entire movie, not the most memorable, because other elements of the book that had either been subtext or alluded to are included. Yes, Lucy is a bit of a slut and we love her for that, though I'm grateful that Stoker framed her death as not a punishment for her promiscuity but as a tragic turn of someone malevolently exploiting her for it. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Dracula's more fantastic powers, such as his shapeshifting, are plainly depicted. Stoker's allusions to Vlad the Impaler are confirmed, and Coppola expands on the relationship between Dracula and Mina, inserting a subplot around the long-forlorn romance. The novel itself was a little bit subversive, aside from Jonathula -- ship name! -- and the band of vampire hunters being too gay to function, most notably among them the Texan. I mean, if your name is Quincy, then you can blame your parents for your homosexuality.

However, it stands out from other adventure literature of the time that only one of the group to make any headway is a woman, Mina, for whom the men in the cast chronically fuss over her delicate feminine sensibilities. Coppola also includes stronger religious overtones to boot. Again, the significant element here is how readily Coppola depicts a Dracula who fucks, whereas Dracula has been more prominently depicted as a reclusive humanoid monster. From Nosferatu, mm… Plan 9 from Outer Space, Salem’s Lost, The Last Voyage of the Demeter, this figure has almost exclusively been painted white and shown with clownishly monstrous features. But Coppola creates a monster for whom the audience looks at and completely understands what Mina is so horny about. Perhaps due to Dracula's capacity to shift forms between beautiful and hideous, man and wolf, Coppola is depicting a visceral (visual?) range of duplicity, the vampire's speciality. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And that wouldn't be an inaccurate reading, were it not for the fact that Mina's feelings for him persist even as she sees him at his most monstrous. Coupled with the fact that Coppola’s Dracula depicts him as a tragic figure whose shunning of God's light was <span stat:id="malaprop">spurned<sup class="add">[sic: spurred]</sup></span> by a broken heart and then turned to vengeance, that draws him closer to Rice's influence.

Okay, sure, the vampires were sparkly for some reason. Apparently there was a scene from the book Meyer saw in a dream, where Edward was sparkling in the Sun and she built the whole damn story around that. For some reason that just screamed “vampire” to her, I guess. And sure, Stewart and Pattinson rubbed a lot of hopeful actors the wrong way for how quick they were to mock and insult the franchise that gave them careers. However, between them and Taylor Lautner, who's getting work and Oscar nominations these days? 

And we could talk about Twilight and why it sucks, but we need to protect our mental health.

So if Rice  made vampires sexy, Meyer seemed to make them…. romantic? I don't even know what to call them because the degree to which the central romance exhibits abusive traits is unsettling to Killing Stalking proportions. “Romantic” is probably a good word, if for no other reason than describing the way Edward and his undead supermodel friends were intended to be seen. They are certainly romance novel cover boys. 

What was the cause for this craze in our culture, though, and how did this affect the vampire mythos? To answer the second question first, it didn't have any effect, at least not in the long-term, though at the time Twilight seized the endocrine systems of teenage girls like nothing else. The fervor for this book series was at a fever pitch of intensity we haven't seen since, and was not dissimilar to that wizard book.

Bush's America, as the first right-wing Evangelical president, was rooted heavily in purity-based values. One thing that mystifies me about people living in America is how they can't see that even if the president does not explicitly make something part of their political agenda, it somehow ends up coming down into the whole culture for a whole decade -- in this case a very loud discourse around pushing for abstinence-only sexual education in schools. Not only that, but projecting those purity standards to adults as well, reeling back from the echoes of the sexual revolution that were redeveloping in the 1990s. Bush’s America turned it in the opposite direction.

Weirdly, this would have been <span stat:id="malaprop">rife<sup class="add">[sic: ripe]</sup></span> for a reinvention of ye olde Victorian vampires, where sex is bad and vampires are bad because they have sex. However, this wouldn't be possible because Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles has since become a global sensation for depicting vampires as tragic, misunderstood and empathetic anti-heroes. In conjunction, the 1994 film adaptation was still a game-changer for the careers of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst, even if Anne Rice had at the time renounced the darkness and began a brief <span stat:id="malaprop">foyer<sup class="add">[sic: foray]</sup></span> back into Catholicism, though that didn't last long.

Vampires, insofar as they were able to be fully developed characters, could not be exclusively villainous anymore, so Twilight hit a peak of popularity when it appealed to the darker edgier fantasies of teenagers, while at the same time having a presentation that the Purity Brigade would give a stamp of approval to. Twilight could maintain the illusion of sexuality without engaging with it in a meaningful way. However, for this reason Meyer divorced herself from the core philosophy of vampires, which only begins at the sparkling thing and the X-Men powers that dominate the latter half of the series. Vampires, as we can identify them, traditionally focus around sexual liberation, for which the author and society may moralize that as good or bad, and because Meyer’s Mormon  vampires -- I feel like that needs to be an episode of What We Do in the Shadows, Mormon vampires come knocking on your door -- are divorced from sex, they are divorced from sexual deviancy, which as per creative license isn't a bad thing.

What's puzzling to me is why the public chose to accept this depiction of vampires that was so far removed from identifiable depictions. For unfortunately, these narrative decisions pushed queer people further out of the genre that we very much built as creators and subjects, which was also a strong component of Bush's personal belief system, which he desperately tried to turn into policy. No gays… how boring.

For which institutional discrimination was the principal topic for True Blood. Based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries, True Blood, in the least Tolkienian way possible, turned vampires into one-to-one allegories for the queer community. At its core True Blood was more than just a vampire drama, it was a powerful platform that explored societal prejudices, civil rights and the intricacies of identity in a way that resonated deeply with the queer community, not just because of the hot men. 

From the onset, True Blood used phrases like “coming out of the coffin” for vampires revealing their existence to humans, mirrored in the real-world experience of coming out. The vampires’ fight for civil rights, recognition and acceptance in human society is reminiscent of the real-world struggles faced by the queer community. This allegory made the vampires’ cause relatable and provided a unique perspective on societal prejudices and the fight for equality. The cultural nature of the series allowed for an exploration of sexuality that goes beyond traditional binaries. Several characters, including some vampires, demonstrate fluid sexual preferences. This fluidity in True Blood reflects the evolving understanding of sexuality in our real world, where labels become less rigid and more people acknowledge the spectrum of sexual orientations. True Blood walked so Elite could dimensionally transcend. It’s porn! With cinematography!

True Blood is a seven-season television program created by HBO, based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries book series by author Charlaine Harris. It aired from 2008 until August of 2014, and follows adventures of several vampires and humans once vampires “come out of the coffin”, or attempted to “mainstream”, integrating themselves into human society (“Thank You”). Set in the small town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, the show is meant to represent a microcosm of American culture and society, with the reactions and experiences of main characters reflective of persons, living and dead, all around the country. The important characters for this paper include; Sookie Stackhouse, a human waitress; Hoyt Thortenberry, a human resident of Bon Temp;, Sarah Newlin, a radical Christian and anti-vampire advocate; “Vampire” Bill, a vampire and native Louisianan who returns to his home in Bon Temps once vampires are revealed to society; Jessica, Bill’s vampire progeny; and Eric and Pam Northman, two vampire businesspersons. Vampires within the world of True Blood are able to mainstream because of their ingestion of “Tru Blood” a synthesized drink that eliminates their need to feed on humans. Vampires are suddenly brought, “out of the coffin”, a term obviously based on the queer term coming out “of the closet”, highlighting the show’s representation of queerness through the vampire.

A running theme in the series is the fear of that which is different or misunderstood, the animosity many humans feel toward vampires in True Blood is not dissimilar to the fear or distrust some individuals harbor toward the queer community to this day. The Fellowship of the Sun, an extremist anti-vampire church in the series, provides a critical examination of how religion can be weaponized against marginalized groups. The church's zealous crusade against vampires draws a parallel to the real-world religious entities that condemn and persecute LGBTQ+ individuals based on dogmatic beliefs. Throughout True Blood vampires rally for the VRA, the Vampire Rights Amendment, which would grant them equal rights as humans. This political backdrop mirrors the very real battle for queer rights, from marriage equality to anti-discrimination laws.

The series juxtaposes the visceral emotions of the vampire characters with these political movements, emphasizing the human (or vampire) faces behind the issues. For many characters, their journey in the series is one of self-acceptance. Just as Jason Stackhouse grapples with his attraction to vampires, perhaps even male ones, or Tara Thornton comes to terms with her own sexuality, many queer individuals wrestle with internalized prejudices before they can fully accept themselves. These, let's say, fictional characters and creatures say a lot about our society, especially those considered the least among us, from the monsters of yore to the dangerous foreigners of the 17 and 1800s to the sexual predators of the 1900s and then the sparkles and civil rights allegories of the 2000s. But what does it say about our society… today?

The mass acceptance of the Staten Island vampires signal more than just a spiritual victory of the rights fights shown in True Blood, but rather an indication that in spite of widespread political and institutional persecution, we seem to be finding acceptance on a societal level that we did not have before, “we” meaning “queer people” but also “we” meaning the sex-positive. Earlier queer leaders in the ‘60s and ‘70s sought to use the sexual revolution to justify the advancement of queer rights. If the stigma is removed from sex itself, then there is little ground for persecuting one for whom they have sex with, consent provided of course.

The Victorians would not see the comedy in What We Do in the Shadows because of the focus on a need for poetic justice of those who knowingly live outside of God's light. We don't want to see these vampires punished, even if they are kind of shitty people sometimes. Instead, we champion their personhood and even their small victories over petty struggles. For who among us has not had the dream of starting a vampire nightclub, or even just had a hard time looking for love without realizing that what you were looking for was there all along? To accept the vampire in their traditional form, as is often presented in What We Do in the Shadows, is to accept the full spectrum of what they were meant to traditionally signify. No longer does the sex-positive vampire require poetic justice, nary a stake to the heart nor a decapitation, and consuming only a consensual amount of garlic. For what threat did Carmilla really afford to anyone, if not the occasional snatching of panties?

To our forebearers in antiquity, the real threat was of sex, and the seduction. Though specifically sex that defied the typical norms of patriarchal power dynamics, the man who is penetrated by another man, the woman who can exchange intimacy without a man, the real evil of vampires was their affinity for challenging the conventional power structures. The murder thing was just icing, but the fear, the real fear, was sex itself.  By no longer fearing the vampire, are we shedding a fear of sex, or are we too, as a people, abandoning the patriarchal structures that so much of history constructed itself around? If this is the moral decay the Victorians feared so much, society does not seem worse off for it. If anything, society is worse for enduring the <span stat:id="malaprop">throngs<sup class="add">[sic: torrents??]</sup></span> of violence against the vampiric, the deviants, women, queers.

Sexuality has come out of the closet. No longer are we forced to hide in the shadows just because we're not having sex to make the next generation of good God-fearing Christians. Dim lamp light has turned into <span stat:id="malaprop">livid<sup class="add">[sic: vivid]</sup></span> LEDs, brightening up the lives of the sex-positive for the whole world to see if they want. And whether they like it -- most do -- or not, fuck them, we're not turning those lights off. We don't have to hide what we do in the shadows anymore.

I genuinely don't know how possible it is to catch this man's plagarism in its entirety — I skipped to a random time in his vampire video, and came across a sentence lifted wholesale from a 2017 PHD thesis.

> The female vampire is the ultimate predator and challenger of the patriarchal system because of her desirability, her threat to penetrate her male victims, and her threat to eat her children. But Carmilla works differently than the female vampires of Dracula. Carmilla does not desire men. When the vampire is a lesbian, she becomes “the destroyer of other women and undermines heteronormative masculine power” (Hobson 11). Carmilla performs this function by corrupting the bonds of friendship she forms with the protagonist Laura.

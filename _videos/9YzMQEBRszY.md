I've been noticing something over the last few months... years, that's been bothering me, but I haven't spoken that much about it. I wonder if you, my dear viewers, have noticed the same thing. That being the complete and utter neglect for the privacy of queer people. 

First let's talk about celebrities. While many people feel like celebrities give up their right to privacy when they become an actor or singer or public figure in general, that's not actually how the world works. You don't give up your right to privacy when you become a teacher or a lawyer.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Of course, the most prominent recent example of this is Kit Connor, who was forced out of the closet this past year when an internet mob essentially accused him of "queerbaiting" (real people can't queerbait, by the way) by playing a queer character in multiple pieces of media while not *actively* being out as queer himself. It got even worse for him when, horror of horrors, he was spotted holding a girl's hand. So to Tamp down on the rising tide of the internet boundary pushing, he came out as bisexual. Some have since accused him of being a *fake* bisexual, and refused to believe him until he has a boyfriend. To them I say: *stop.* 

</james>
<from></from>
<james span=2 {% include timecode %}>

But he's far from the only celebrity to be *pushed* out of the closet. <mark num=1 v>In 1996</mark>, <mark num=2 v>Nathan Lane</mark> <mark num=3>appeared on Oprah</mark> <mark num=4 v>to promote *The Birdcage*. Prior to the taping, he</mark> specifically <mark>said he didn't want to talk about his sexuality. But when they went live, Oprah began pushing for answers anyway.</mark> <!-- TODO: look up Nathan Lane episode from Matt Baume. -->

<mark>Lance Bass was forced to make a public statement about his sexuality in 2006, after</mark> <mark>Perez Hilton nicknamed him "Princess Frosty Locks" and wouldn't stop posting</mark> blog entries about how obviously gay he was. <mark x>Perez Hilton also instigated a similar campaign against Neil Patrick Harris the same year.</mark> And it's only gotten worse since social media became a factor. Rumors swirled around online about actresses such as Rebel Wilson and Kristen Stewart, eventually leading to them coming out under threats from tabloid sites.

<h3>Lance Bass</h3>

<u>[Instagram [@lancebass](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2vM46klKJ0/)]</u>

<mark>The *NSYNC crooner was forced to make a public statement about his sexuality in 2006 after</mark> gay gossip blogger <mark>Perez Hilton nicknamed him “Princess Frosty Locks” and wouldn’t stop posting</mark> nasty and degrading articles about him. In 2007, Bass told [Attitude](https://attitude.co.uk/article/lance-bass-perez-hilton-bullied-me-to-come-out/5395/), “Two years before I came out I was really bullied on the internet by bloggers. That’s when Perez Hilton just started and was just really malicious against me.” The singer finally came out in an exclusive interview with People “because of the bloggers like him hounding me.”

<h3>Neil Patrick Harris</h3>

<u>[Instagram [@nph](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGOXvENF8j7/)]</u>

Last June, the actor/singer/comedian opened up about <mark x>when he, too, fell victim to a vicious outing campaign by Perez Hilton in 2006.</mark> “[He] started posting about me and asking people to come forward with truths or stories,” Harris recalled. “Then it became apparent that I needed to make some sort of decisive respectable move.” The actor added that his biggest concern was coming out in a way that was respectful to his husband. “It wasn’t simple for me,” he said, “but I tried to represent myself well.”

It's not like the old days when gay rumors would start up in a Hollywood studio or a record label would have a star paired up with a similarly famous celebrity to hide their sexuality. Though many fans still think this *does* happen with people like Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. Studios and labels have *much* less control over stars now, though they do continue to influence many people to stay *in* the closet. I personally know of at least *three* Hollywood actors who have been in major box office successes who are out to their friends and family but not to the public. Which *some say* is as bad as them *lying* to their fans. But why do fans have a right to know who's dating who? I blame Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez for this. They helped reignite the celebrity couple industry back in the 90s, and it hasn't died down since.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The parasocial environment of Twitter and Instagram has allowed the walls to fall down between fans and celebrities. Where once fans only read what stars publicists wanted them to read, now they can keep up with their faves on an almost minute-by-minute basis. So of course, they want to know *everything* about them. Because they feel more like long-distance friends now than Hollywood stars. Which is bad enough when it comes to straight people, but it's *doubly* bad for queer people because *our* privacy can, in far too many cases, be the only barrier keeping us safe from violent bigots. The walls we put up can be very important and create a safe zone in a world where our safety is *apparently* up for debate.

I've been thinking about all of this for quite some time, but it all started to crystallize in my mind when I read the book *The Cabin at the End of the World* by Paul G Tremblay, since a film adaptation of it entitled *Knock At The Cabin* was being readied for release. And in the pages of this book, I saw how queer privacy can be so easily neglected.

Online privacy is becoming more and more important as our lives shift evermore to exclusively online spaces. --> As someone who was doxed only within the last few months, I know how important it is for your *location* to be as opaque as possible online. [...]<!-- Atlas has also been incredibly helpful for this channel as well, since some of the content we cover isn't legally available in Canada without an absurdly priced cable package. I've been able to use their geolocation feature to convince *certain streaming services* that I'm actually in the US, giving me access to a lot of the queer content I *wouldn't* have access to in Canada. And I get to actually support those queer shows instead of pirating them, which is pretty nice. Atlas VPN also keeps your Google search history safe, which I know some of you would very much appreciate, and protects you from malware, and can even get you better deals on merchandise by tricking websites into thinking that you're a *local* buyer instead of an international one. This has helped me a lot with my ever increasing anime merch collection as I descend further and further into weebdum. And it's just the best deal on a VPN out there. Like I said at only 1.99 a month for a three year subscription their pricing can't be beat.

## Part One: Full Coverage

<james {% include timecode %}>

Because this is less about *Knock at the Cabin* and more ***about*** <u>[gesturing broadly]</u> *Knock at the Cabin*, there will be spoilers. Skip ahead to [Part Two: Policy Reminder](#{{ "Part Two: Policy Reminder" | slugify}}), if you want to see the movie and go in fresh. If you don't want to see the movie, we're not going to hinge *everything* on knowing what happens in the plot, so you're not going to be kept out of the loop.

I'm basing these ideas entirely on the book, though, titled *Cabin at the End of the World*, because, you know, the movie wasn't *out* when I wrote this. Judging from the trailers, it seems like the movie is following the plot pretty closely though. However given how the book ends, I *could* foresee a studio maybe wanting to change that ending. Some things you can get away with in books that audiences simply will not tolerate if they see it on screen. 

</james>

<james {% include timecode %}>

Anyway, *Knock at the Cabin*'s general premise is that a pair of gay fathers take their adopted daughter to a secluded cabin getaway. A group of hooligans show up and barges in and takes the family hostage with the *intent* of causing violence. Before you say "been there, done that", the *twist* is that the group is a doomsday cult that's trying to prevent the end of the world. According to them, unless the gay family picks one family member and chooses to kill them, the world will come to an end. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<u>[Monty Python waiting music plays over a cartoony yellow sign]: Light Spoiler</u>

The group demonstrates that they are *not* full of shit. It's a long story, but the audience can be confident that these cultists really can prophesy the end of the world, and they're not just whack job religious nuts looking for a... gay bashing. Which is kind of scarier.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<u>[Monty Python waiting music plays over a cartoony red sign]: Heavy Spoiler</u>

The daughter gets killed. Which is why I said they may want to change the ending of this movie, because that's a *little dark* for the big screen. But M. Night Shyamalan *has gone* to pretty dark places before, even with kids so... <u>[shrugs]</u> maybe!

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<u>[Monty Python waiting music plays over a cartoony red sign]: Heavy Spoiler</u>

But because it's the cultists who *accidentally* kill the girl, and not the other two members of the gay family, the apocalypse prevention plan is void. And the reader (and presumably the movie going audience) is led to believe, though remains unsure, that the apocalypse is still DTF. If anything, they may swap out the daughter for one of the husbands, to make it a little bit more palatable in the movie? But the ambiguous supernatural world-ending has some serious Shyamalan Vibes, so I can assume that this *is* where the movie is headed. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The point remains however: the continuation of the world *hinges* on the destruction of a queer family. Which... I didn't really even think of that when I first read the book. Someone pointed it out to me on a stream, and then... you can't really *unthink* what has been thought. 

But, here we go: because that idea opens the story up to a *myriad* of different readings. When something isn't *just* about showing representation for representation's sake, that means it's *about* something. Which means... there's a lot to unpack here.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The book was written by Paul G Tremblay. Though you *wouldn't* know that from the movie's marketing, leading me to believe that the daughter... *might actually get killed* and M Night doesn't want anyone reading the book and spoiling the ending. There isn't as much biographical information about Tremblay as say... other horror authors like Stephen King. But in the context of queerness? Everything I could find about him indicates that he is straight. And while I continue to hold my position that you *should not need to be* of a certain identity to create characters *of* that identity, there *are* some life experiences that are a *little bit sensitive* to that particular community. 

In the queer community, for instance, violence against us is one of them. Violenced<sup class="add">[sic: Violence]</sup> against our families is something that our *art* has only really begun to explore. For instance, 2017's *American Horror Story Cult* explored this, and that was the first time it popped up on my radar. However when it comes to *Knock at the Cabin*, the *book* (and presumably the movie) one of the strange selling points is that the queerness of the dads is more or less... irrelevant to the plot. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In the book, one of the fathers has a flashback to a queer bashing, but aside from that it's entirely not a topic of discussion, really. In fact, the cultists go out of their way to say that they're *super duper* not homophobic! But given that this is a creator who is explicitly making a decision to write outside his lived experiences, why did he write it like this? Because the story would have been *exactly the same*... if it was swapped out for a straight couple, one of whom had been attacked in the past. What statements may Tremblay be making? What readings could we take from this story?

There are, of course, positive messages. An argument for queer sympathy would implore the reader to acknowledge the threat the queer people and their budding families are put under in this new age of... *tepid* queer acceptance. It may be that the *real tragedy* is that this queer family went through *all the trouble* and rigmaro<sup class="add">[sic: rigmarol]</sup> of eking out adoption only for the child to be ripped away anyway. Especially with the condition of the American Supreme Court, it's altogether *not* out of the question that children could be taken away from their queer mothers and fathers. Just look at what's happening to *trans* children and their supportive *biological* parents in the southern states right now.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

However, if that's the intended reading, it's kind of weak. Because while adoption is a very long methodical expensive struggle, so are fertility treatments for women. The threat of violence against a child you worked exceptionally hard to produce is not a fear that is *exclusive* to queer families. And quite frankly neither is adoption. The most optimistic, dare I say, *queer-positive* reading of the story is that Tremblay is speaking to the family bond within queer families being just as strong as they would be among straight ones. The entire story is built on the premise that both queer fathers are unwilling and *incapable* of sacrificing another of the trio. A death only occurs by accident. Whereas queer detractors *may* assume that one or both of the fathers would just be willing to throw the family away to save their own skin. 

And honestly...? Come a bit closer. <u>[Camera digitally zooms in to James's face]</u>

<u>[Whispering]</u> I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: I think that may be the intended reading. <u>[Puts finger to lips]:</u> Ssh! Okay? Just between us.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<u>[Cut back to normal shot]</u>

However, even though that's a possible takeaway, the story is still built around fantasizing trauma, tragedy, and violence upon a queer family. And that still makes me a little bit uncomfortable. Just taking a look at the optics of the story. Because in spite of these readings, there remains some *very*... very homophobic ones.

First off, the continuation of the world is *predicated* on a queer family's destruction. This could be interpreted as queer families being a threat to societal cohesion, or such vagaries that are pushed by right-wing pundits. Another reading would claim that queer rights as a whole need to be "put away" to focus on more apocalyptic features of our current world. Things like climate change, economic collapse, plagues, and this never-ending string of *conflicts* that we've been embroiled in since 9/11. (The latter of which I'm partially convinced *future historians(?)* are actually going to refer to as World War III.)

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This could hold a certain "Make America Great Again" kind of nostalgia that sort of remaps history to insert that "society he really started to take a nosedive when """the gays""" began insisting that they needed to start families". And that "if we're gonna stop the world from burning down, it's a small price to pay to put the boot down on some home-making queens". 

The interesting nuance behind this story, though, is that the cultists cannot be the ones to murder one of the family members. It *must* be the family itself that breaks up from within. Translated into a real world suggestion that the onus is on queer families to break up on their own volition in order to maintain social order. Because if the government or bigots do these actions against queer families, then the social outcry will dissolve social cohesion regardless. Instead, if queerness quietly *goes back into the closet*... all will be right with the world. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

An even more negative reading of the story could contain a nasty message of queer people, saying "provided how much violence has been used against you and your community historically, is it not *irresponsible* for you to start families and invite children into that kind of threat of violence?" Which... would be wrong. Because we don't blame victims for their circumstances. Even if the objective is to be normal, the condition of queer rights is predicated on the ability to choose how you want to fit into the heterohegemony &mdash; or not &mdash; without persecution. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now granted, these *very* negative readings of the story are all... far more nuanced than bigots and right wingers (or... quite frankly, centrists) are usually capable of demonstrating. And I want to be clear, I am *not* saying that Paul G. Tremblay or M. Night Shyamalan are queerphobic.

And, quite frankly, he may very well be bisexual, pansexual, or asexual; you don't need to only marry dudes to be a queer man. His identity is only really important for questioning why it was *so important* for this story to be focused on a queer family. It would help us understand... what the intended takeaway could be. However, within the story there is a lack of guiding framing devices to really suggest what the takeaway *should* be. The presence of homophobic readings is not necessarily a problem with the story, but a problem with the fact that these are... *real* issues and *real* discussions that are imposed on the queer community from the *outside*. The fact that these readings are *possible* is concerning. But only because these reflect the bigotry we actually experience in day-to-day life. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In a world *without* homophobia, this story would not be remarkable for the sake of gay dads, but rather the weird apocalyptic cult and vague paranormal overtones. Make no mistake, violence against us is a threat to our immediate safety. But these ideological discussions around our identity are pivotal to the ongoing progress to facilitate our long-term security. The fight for our rights needs to be both reactionary and methodical. We need an ideal objective to know how we should navigate immediate threats in order to *strategically* move towards our long-term goals. And even the reactionary solutions are not usually efficient, they *are* necessary until we can progress our rights to a point where we do not *need* those kind of solutions.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

For instance, at least in America, where the story takes place, leaning on the Supreme Court for what rights have been won for us may not have been the best plan. If only retrospectively, now that the Supreme Court has decided <u>[exhasperated]</u> the former rulings *no longer matter.* 

If the immediate goal was marriage, getting that goal by any means necessary may have *compromised* the long-term progress to... <u>[furrows brow, turns to camera]</u> Was there even a plan of what to do after the marriage fight was won? 

Regardless of whether the creators involved in this project are gay or straight, I feel like such a hot-button discussion *ought to* have warranted a greater sensitivity for diminishing the presence of these readings. If homophobic readings *are* present, then there *are* ways to make it more difficult for the audience to come away with that reading. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

For instance, yes, there is a straight reading of... *Yuri on Ice*, because the confirmation was never *verbalized*. However, the mental gymnastics you have to do in order to justify their straightness is, in itself, worthy of a gold medal. Many of you may insist that this is just a story and that nobody's going to take these homophobic messages away from it. But keep in mind that Ted Cruz took away a reading of *Star Wars* that singled out Luke Skywalker... as a randian objectivist. When are we supposed to take messaging for face value, like in *Star Wars*, and how are we supposed to distinguish that from media where the intended takeaway is buried in subtext? 

Like my go-to example of *Fight Club*, where the condemning takeaway is actually more clear in the book. The answer usually lies in the resolution, and unfortunately when it comes to *Knock at the Cabin*, the ending is a bit too ambiguous to be definitive. And in spite of the fact that these cultists are explicitly described as *not* gay bashing wackos, the *setting* is indicative of these aforementioned queer anxieties. Especially when a straight couple would have accomplished the *exact same story* without nearly as much baggage.

Cynically, I may add that, perhaps, the couple was made to be gay... for no other reason than to distinguish them from... a range of other "murderous stranger shows up at a family's rural residence" stories. Which, again, is more likely than deliberate homophobia. The fact of the matter is that this kind of narrative is popping up in a period of time... when queer people are coming under a new wave of threats. Where many of us are being attacked and forced out of spaces we *believed*... could be safe. 

See, we don't really have to be worried about bigotry knocking at our door anymore as much as we... worry about bigotry showing up in our DMs...

## Part Two: Policy Reminder

The internet was a revolutionary tool for the organization of queer rights. Our leaders *had* depended on phone calls and then spreading information through newsletters and bulletins. In the new millennium, online communities could grow up at a chat rooms, blogs, and early social media platforms like Myspace. If information passes easier, then we can organize easier. Queer communities gravitated to digital spaces because unlike *other* marginalized communities, we *did not* have generational districts which we were born into. A lesbian was just as likely to be born into a family in rural South Dakota as one in Brooklyn. Whereas a homogeneously white community in Maine was not likely to suddenly have a large group of Lebanese children born into the maternity ward.

<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Ethnic communities in cities where immigrant families typically pooled were not only tightly knit, but were densely packed into a few city blocks, like Little Italy, or various Chinatowns, or black neighborhoods. Word of mouth was *much* more effective at passing through these areas because most people in the communities were... in these areas. While there may be a gay district of a city, the queer population may be concentrated here, but most queer people may live throughout the city, and commute between their residents and these bars, clubs, and wherever else that the community has organized. For this reason, internet organizations have been revolutionary for the disabled, the deaf and hard of hearing, or any other communities that are mostly ignored through... <u>[air quotes]</u> "random sampling". 

Which is why Elon Musk's Twitter meltdowns *would be hilarious*... if it wasn't for the fact that the platform is essential for a lot of people's advocacy organizing in the modern world. If anything else, the gays are savvy.

I may have recently come under criticism for [claiming that the AIDS epidemic took a *grand* majority of our brilliant creative minds](fE4I6WhPryc#died_from_aids), leaving out exceptions like Andy Warhol (who... by some accounts was asexual) or Elton John (who <span stat:id="baa">by all accounts</span> was not). Naturally, not all interesting gay people were horny, and not all of them who *were* horny were taken from us. This is based on what *could* have been in the 1980s and 90s, based on the prominence of queer creators in the 70s and 60s. And just... how many queer people died of AIDS related complications in general.

In spite of that, this shouldn't suggest we lost our brilliant industrious minds. Queer newsletters and publications took a swift turn to online spaces as our fights around the world began to turn to marriage equality in Europe and America, and basic rights and protections in many other places. This information mobility helped spread awareness, demonstrate the power of the community, and soften the general public's opinion of us. And overall helped us organize at a much swifter rate than otherwise.

<james {% include timecode %}>

It's no surprise that as home computers became standard in every household, queer rights started to actually make tangible progress for the first time. However, while our *leaders* were tech savvy, our bigoted detractors did eventually catch up. The internet made it much easier for them to harass us, it seems. Before they needed to either live in LA, San Francisco, New York, or any of the other significant urban areas to harass us en mass. (Or actually pay for postage to send a hateful letter.) But it came to be that they could just *fire off some emails* or invade message boards. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Almost every queer person I know has gotten *some* kind of hate email or DM. Hate mail for queer people, especially creators and people with a platform, range from structured sermons with Biblical references to... just unhinged ranting tirades which amount to nothing more than a collection of red flag buzzwords accusing us of sexually perverse actions and... promising any range of violent retributions. So basically running the gamut of Republican politicians!

Ask anyone with a halfway prominent platform: anonymity and privacy are illusions. For those who know how, with a little patience, dedication, and untreated mental illness, it can be a relatively simple process to find someone's personal information or even an address. Doxing is a *very real threat* for people who are already the target of discrimination. Coupled with the fact that law enforcement have historically under-investigated crimes and violence against queer victims. Doxing someone is among the greatest flexes of privilege. Because it acknowledges that the target does not have a viable recourse for violence against them.

It plays off of the classic "I know where you live" Trope in horror movies. Where the possible victim is reminded that they are not safe in a place that they had *assumed* they would be. Sure, someone throwing homophobic slurs in public is one thing, but once the slurs and threats are coming from inside the house? Things get very real, very fast. 

Doxing and threats are becoming one of the most common ways to silence queer voices. Even as our detractors claim queer people do it to them. I'm sure they do, but there are significantly less of us than there are of them, and their platforms are traditionally *much* larger. To the point where old Joanne tweeting at a prominent trans figurehead could be adjacent to putting out a social media hit. At best, we can hope the hit stays within the twitterverse. 

The frustrating part is that... as these dog whistling bigots blanket us *all* as barbarians for actions they too engage in, queer people stare down lists of threats and criticism... for simply existing.

‘Gay covering’, in line with Yoshino’s (2002, 2006) work, <mark>refers to the acts of gay persons</mark> to disattend or <mark>tone down their sexuality in order to fit better (or easier) into the mainstream society. The demands of gay persons to ‘cover’ are recognized</mark>, both by Yoshino and by Ghosh (2018), <mark>as constituting a system oppression</mark> by <mark>which LGBT+<sup cn>1</sup> persons are coerced to act in certain ways, with substantive threats of punishment for failing to do so.</mark> For Ghosh, these demands to cover are not, however, the only oppressive demands that LGBT+ persons are subjected to. To the contrary, Ghosh argues that Yoshino’s critique of covering incorporates another demand on LGBT+ persons, this time to ‘reverse cover’ – to flaunt and signal – that, according to Ghosh, is ‘just as oppressive as the oppression it is mobilized to dismantle’ (p. 73).

Almost every gay teenager has the fantasy of being *just* as affectionate with their real (or in most cases, imaginary) boyfriend or girlfriend as their straight friends are. But, there *is* an immediate fear when those thoughts enter your mind. Of the repercussions of doing so. There did seem to be *some* movement on this front in the last couple of decades. It used to be that you had to go to the gay hotspots of Castro Street, Chelsea, or Church Street to feel comfortable and safe expressing your queerness. Unless there was a Pride Parade going on. 

But when I was in my late teens, I saw a marked shift to where a queer person could be comfortable being themselves. The map seemed to open up to include most major cities and even small towns. Gays were making out *on every street corner in America*, according to conservatives. This was never really the case. But it's the image that was sent out by the mainstream media. That homophobia had, for the most part, been dealt with. Especially after gay marriage started going mainstream. If we could get married, we must have won the war.

But fights over people refusing to issue marriage licenses, and refusing to bake wedding cakes... painted a very different picture. We hadn't won the war. We'd merely back the enemy into a corner... and now they felt threatened enough to retaliate in any way they saw fit.

The rise in right-wing radicalism, seen in the likes of the MAGA movement, the increasing hate toward trans people, and the *surprising* rise of actual fascists like France's [Marine Le Pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen), lines up directly with the rise of LGBTQ hate crimes.

This gave gay men a sense of safety, I think, believing that the target had shifted. And so we gays could relax.

I think that maybe we've given the impression along the way that we won't fight back against threats to us. It used to be that when the government refused to protect us, or when it was even the government that was doing *harm* to us, we would mobilize and demonstrate.

We demonstrated that our humanity was not rooted in our ability to *passively endure* in complacent silence.

This "be nice to our oppressors" strategy led to *exponentially* more arrests and attacks against queer people. However, one night in New York City, a group of gay men, lesbians, and trans women had had enough and fought back, lighting the flame of the Stonewall Riots and the modern LGBTQ Rights Movement.

But today? We as a community seem much more timid, much more willing to take a backhand to the face, literally or metaphorically, as long as it doesn't make *us* look bad. It only makes the bigots look bad, right? That's why there's so few of them now! And they have like *zero* political power. Can't get anyone elected to save their lives. And *certainly* don't tout bigoted rhetoric in public! And never confront *anyone* over their gender identity in a public bathroom. (That's sarcasm by the way.)

Not to be alarmist, but it does seem like these people are only gaining political power. There are right-wingers who label themselves <u>[air quotes]</u> "activists" because they've convinced themselves that *they*, often white if not wealthy, are being... persecuted. People like that Republican staffer I mentioned earlier (whose name is Rachel Bovard, by the way), claim that this political party (which is really an ideology, not an identity) is under threat of destruction. And whether or not they're delusional enough to actually believe it, their supporters sure do. They are gaining more and more power within the Republican party.

We used to think the Tea Party caucus was crazy. Now *they've disbanded* because they weren't crazy enough for these new ones! And these are the people we're supposed to negotiate with?! To be kind and empathetic with? To compromise with? And put on our best behavior for? Because we must be polite to our oppressors? Because even as they decry us, denounce us, insult us, confront us, question us, harm us, and silence us, it all becomes a discussion of *their* feelings, doesn't it? 

<u>[Empathetic music in background slowly fading up, marking the end of the video approaching.]</u>

How *dare* we silence them for trying to suppress us and oppress us. We're so afraid of these people turning around and calling us bullies that we become *toothless*. What are we gonna do? Start a hashtag on Twitter? March on Washington or state capital for a weekend, and then go home? We're certainly not going to fight for our rights and security in any way that will remind the population at large that bigotry is never in season. We used to do that. But we haven't in a long long time.

We thought our safety was secured. The doors and windows to the house in which our rights seemed *so safe* were locked up tight. And so we could sleep soundly and move on with our lives. But we seemingly forgot that windows... <u>[glances at windows in background behind him]</u> ...are only made of glass. Glass through which the bigots could see us. And then smash through when they got sick of seeing us, and take away our safety.

Does that mean we should draw the curtains and hide in the closets? No. Hell no! We used to have queer guard dogs that would fight, but most of them died in the 80s and 90s. And others were put down because... *some of us* thought they were too much to handle. The neighbors might be offended by how loudly they barked. But with the repeal of abortion rights and voting rights in America, our neighbors houses have now been broken into. And our windows have been smashed.

So I think it's time we get some new guard dogs. Loud, vicious, unstoppable forces of protection, that will scare the *shit* out of these bigots and send them running home. Put a big rainbow colored sign on the front fence: "Beware the Queers. They bite back."

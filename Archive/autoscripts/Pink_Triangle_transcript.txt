for when the Holocaust has been written or spoken about it's often focused on the
stories of the millions of Jewish people and political prisoners that were put into concentration camps or killed the
voices of smaller groups have been lost over the years many of these groups were small before they were imprisoned and
came out even smaller historians overlooked many of these groups such as the Jehovah's
Witnesses Romani neuroatypical and gay men after after the war was over because
many of these groups still had negative stigmas attached to them and still do to this day gay men had it particularly
rough after the war they were often silenced put in Soviet prisons and left
off of memorials this eraser of their histories has left minimal sources about the
subject survivors felt shame for being imprisoned for being gay and often
stayed quiet about their experiences as the last few home sexual survivors finally began speaking some
information came forth about what it was like being gay in Germany before and during Hitler's Reign by the turn of the
20th century it was near impossible to be gay and out anywhere in the world
cities that today hold huge Pride parades then prosecuted gay men under
any number of anti-sodomy laws these laws spread across North America Europe
and Asia but there was an odd bubble of Tolerance in the middle of Europe Berlin
though Germany had anti-gay laws on the book since it was just a loose collection of independent states they
were seldom enforced in Germany gay culture thrived and Berlin was
recognized as the gay capital of the world even during World War I the queer subculture survived many clubs and bars
restaurants and dance halls all within Berlin's gay district Drew patrons who preferred to be intimate with members of
their own gender sometimes in these settings it was hard to tell who was a man and who was a
woman in 1918 the first gay themed movie different from the others was made in
Germany produced to educate the public about homosexuality it was written by Dr Magnus herfeld a researcher in human
sexuality the British writer Christopher isherwood left England to live in Berlin in the 1920s because it was a much more
exciting and welcoming place for gay men in England gay men were still being
tried as sodomites and sentenced to castration and hard labor while in Berlin it wasn't entirely shocking to
see two men holding hands or even kissing many years later isherwood's book Christopher and His Kind was
written about his experiences in Berlin gay men and women as well as groups supporting their rights had even made
great strides in achieving some form of legal recognition in Germany as well the
most important goal and end to Legal discrimination had been called for by a number of weighty figures in groups even
outside the legal and medical professions moreover a number of gay rights organizations had sprung up
across the country in the big cities especially Berlin and Hamburg widespread tolerance and acceptance of gay people
was becoming the norm greater public support for changes in the criminal law meant that political parties had also
been under increasing pressure to take a position on gay rights their different attitudes became apparent in 1929 when
the right committee on criminal law discussed the draft of a common German penal code and recommended among other
things the deletion of section 175 the part of the German legal code
that made homosexuality illegal gay people would be accepted openly in German society and by the
German government as soon as the early 1930s gay men and women in Europe had
found their Eden but other winds were blowing through Germany that would scatter any
meaningful attempt at gay rights part one Stormfront
approaching in the years after World War I extreme economic crisis widespread
unemployment unprecedented inflation and bitter civil unrest engulfed to Germany
with the shock of military defeat at the end of the war fear and insecurity would grip all social
classes it was a war that left 1.7 million German soldiers dead and another
another 4 million injured the returning veterans convinced that the leaders of the country had betrayed them believed
that they had been stabbed in the back most Germans agreed how was it possible for the
Kaiser's Mighty Army to have been defeated only days before the end hadn't the Army's own press releases promised
the certain victory of the Sacred German cause what most Germans suspected what
the Press trumpeted was the traitors at home had caused the Great catastrophe
War profiteers foreigners from the East Communists and socialists and especially the Jews all were to blame for Germany's
humiliation the country was swept by a tidal wave of guilt and anger that was felt most prominently by younger men who
had not seen military service the idea that the Empire the Kaiser and the Golden Age of German
dominance had been brought down by internal enemies was prevalent enraged former soldiers and
younger men created violent band hands that roamed across Germany a profound yearning could be felt for stability and
revenge at all levels of society from farm and Factory workers to middle-class
businessmen and big city intellectuals the Weare Republic's experiment in democracy and social tolerance was
gradually undermined by mistrust inequality and violence long before Adolf Hitler entered politics one is
almost tempted to say that the Republic was not brought down by Hitler he merely saved it from suicide by murdering it
himself five factors were roing together to bring down the accepted order in
Germany firstly after World War I the Spectre of Revolution frightened many
older people it had been accomplished in Russia by the Bolsheviks and they had relied on the spread of revolution in
Europe to guarantee their survival it seemed to many that the Revolt in Munich in 1918 was but the
opening shot in a class war secondly in this climate dozens of racist and
virulently nationalistic groups had begun to flourish each more fanatical
than the last a third Factor cracked open the thin walls of stability and did more than any other to destroy trust and
hope the MTH inflation of 1922 and 23 in just 16 months the German mark
soared from 192 marks to the American dollar to a staggering 4.2
trillion the financial faith of the country was shattered Beyond repair the
deepening crisis was compounded by a fourth factor a rapid rise in unemployment especially following the
crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 which killed half of central Europe's financial institutions the
number of unemployed workers increased from 1.5 million to 3.2 million the
actual number is estimated by some Economist to have been more than 6 million a fifth and most toxic
ingredient had been added added to the social mess the Nazi party as the unemployment rate Rose Nazi
membership grew the Nazi party not only provided food weapons and a magnificent
uniform but proclaimed a new purpose a new faith and a new profit inflation and unemployment had
catapulted into Power a man who promised rebirth to all Aryan Germans regardless
of economic status but that shouldn't suggest that everyone in Ware Republic
Germany was destitute during the Republic the homosexual subculture had thrived compared to the rest of the
world of course those in the spotlight famous actors designers dancers doctors
politicians directors and lawyers had to live with a certain amount of abuse but many had acquired power money and even
connections to the Ware government which served as protection as Hitler's influence grew
the average gay German could go unnoticed and undisturbed though their apparent failure to lose their jobs did
enrage many Germans as self-employed Artisans many could still sell their
Wares outside of Germany but the heterosexual majority who worked for
employers were trapped by the growing inflation police began rethinking their
leniency on homosexual men the average lesbian on the other hand enjoyed a kind
of legal immunity during the Ware years organized lesbian costume balls were held
luxurious lesbian bars and nightclubs flourished their owners never feared a police raid the reason neither the
second German Empire nor the Ware Republic had ever passed laws forbidding or punishing sexual acts between women
but sexual tolerance began to disappear just as quickly as Germany's economy began to
crumble part two paragraph 175 as the Roaring 20s passed and the
Nazi party began began to gain power there began an increasing fear of
homosexuality gay men were another scapegoat that the Nazi party could used to explain why Germany was failing as a
nation homosexuals were portrayed as weak degenerates who had to rely on state aid to get by despite the majority
being self-employed their behaviors as homosexuals were what made them weak and
if they were allowed to continue it would corrupt other citizens not to mention that these men were having
non-procreative sex at a time when the Nazis wanted to have as many strong good German babies as
possible and so sex without the intention of having children was seen as
taboo Nazi leader Hinrich Kimler said that homosexuality would deprive Germany
of the Next Generation they owed her paragraph 175 became the way the Nazis could more efficiently regulate this
homosexual Behavior the law that prohibited sex between two men but not two women dated
back to 18 71 when the King of Prussia United various kingdoms into one German
state with the new constitution paragraph 175 stated a male who commits
a sex offense with another male or allows himself to be used by another male for a sex offense shall be punished
with imprisonment the vague language of the law had allowed it to go unenforced but not anymore on May 14th
1928 the Nazis published a response to a question posed about their stance on
eliminating paragraph 175 they said it is not necessary that
you and I live but it is necessary that the German people live and it can only
live if it can fight for life means fighting and it can only fight if it
maintains its masculinity it can only maintain its masculinity if it exercises discipline
especially in matters of Love free love and deviance are undisciplined therefore
we reject you as we reject anything that hurts our nation anyone who thinks of
homosexual love is our enemy we reject anything which emasculates our people
and makes it a play thing for our enemies for we know that life is a fight and it is madness to think that men will
ever Embrace fraternally Natural History teaches us
the opposite might makes right this outright public stance
against homosexuality was only the beginning of many more strengthened laws and
persecutions Hinrich himler said that homosexuality was not just a criminal act but a danger to the future of the
Aryan race as soon as Hitler took power he attempted to strengthen anti-homosexuality laws amendments to
paragraph 175 were put into place which strengthened the previous version
considerably now any suggestion or suspicion of homosexuality could be punishable by
arrest whether or not you were caught committing a homosexual act the revised
wording for paragraph 175 defining a sex offense between males dictated its
punishment paragraph 175a states that a punishment of 10
years in prison May apply to any man who one rapes another man two coerces
another man into sex three has sex with any man under the age of 21 and four has
sex with a man this revised version of paragraph 175 was much more lengthy than
the previous version and makes sure there are many more opportunities for men to be caught and persecuted the
revised version also doesn't explicitly State what constitutes a sex offense between two men so many men were
prosecuted simply because they hugged another man received a letter from a gay friend or even just had go gossip about
their behavior going around the neighborhood any and all signs of homosexuality were to be stopped in July
1932 the Nazi party won the most seats in the German Parliament though far from
a majority 37% Hitler could now form a government
in Coalition with other parties eventually the Centrist parties agreed to accept Hitler as leader and in
January of 1933 he was named chancellor of Germany the next month homosexual
rights organizations were banned the Nazis moved quickly to suppress any objectors to the new
regime enemies of the state were rounded up in raids on homes and businesses and
transported to the newly constructed concentration
camps part three the night of the Long Knives the years from 1929 to the end of
the Ware Republic were years of M oun in tension to facilitate power political and militarily the Nazis commissioned a
militia the brown shirts or the sa and as the Nazis attained even more
political legitimacy the sa became even more repressively efficient their leader
Ernst Rome was gay himself and was Hitler's right-hand man through his rise
to power from early on Rome displayed an irreverent attitude toward those higher
in rank than he a trait that got him in trouble throughout his career later he would observe that an intelligent
thinking subordinate is the natural enemy to his Superior Rome often went
out of his way to let his superiors know that he considered them inept his ill-concealed contempt did not endear
him to the Army's High command Hitler admired this trait in him though until Rome's criticisms were
turned toward the furer himself Hitler promised to Germany's youth an endless military parade replete with death
dashing Insignia Badges and Banners he invented special ranks for sa recruits
and later for the SS he offered the vision of a brave Sunny world of soldiering for those who
had given up hope his enemies he threatened with war and Extinction they
would be eliminated ruthlessly Hitler's favorite word and he enjoyed saying that
heads would roll rome thought the theatricality was a bit much despite
their disagreement Hitler made Rome chief of the sa where he recruited thousands of adoring unsophisticated
young men according to his Recollections and even his most venomous enemies within the Nazi party never disputed
this he never began a sexual relationship with anyone under his command his sexual habits with men did
not go unnoticed though and Drew particular ey from himler who was his subordinate at the time but Hitler was
growing more attached to himler now rather than Rome mostly because himler knew how to stroke his ego and Stoke his
fear years he convinced him that Rome intended on murdering Hitler and taking lead of the Nazi party himself operation
hummingbird or more popularly known as the night of the Long Knives was a blood bath that began on June 28th and lasted
until July 3rd 1934 seeing Adolf Hitler wreck the sa militia and order the
shooting of its Chief ER strome he no longer needed his oldest Ally whose open homosexuality was becoming a
liability because Hitler and himler had been secretly building up the SS a black
shirted crew of bodyguards and thugs on the night of June 28th Hitler fled to
Berlin accompanied by his usual Entourage and a small cohort of ss bodyguards before the sun fell Ern Drome
and several of his allies were arrested and transported to stalheim prison meanwhile the Swift Purge was taking its
toll on Berlin and other German cities about 300 people were killed many in no
way connected with the SA but hated or feared by someone in the Nazi bureaucracy from Munich Hitler ordered
the sa regulars to the brown house screaming that they were all homosexual pigs though he well knew that only a few
in Rome's immediate Entourage Were Gay they were all killed so far Ernst Rome
had been spared but on July 1st an SS officer entered Rome's prison cell
handed him a revolver and said I'll be back in 15 minutes you have a choice
Rome resp responded let Adolf do it himself I'm not going to do his job anymore later that day the SS executed
him reportedly Hitler didn't have the stomach to kill him himself as The Purge
claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans it could hardly be kept secret at first its Architects seemed split on
how to handle the event Nazi leader Herman Goring instructed police stations to burn all documents concerning the
actions of the past two days meanwhile Joseph go the Nazi propaganda Minister tried to
prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead but at the same time used a
July 2 radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented Rome from overthrowing the government and throwing
the country into turmoil then on July 13th 1934 Hitler Justified The Purge in a
nationally broadcast speech to the Reich in this hour I was responsible for
the fate of the German people and thereby I became the Supreme judge of the German people concerned with
presenting the massacre as legally sanctioned Hitler had the cabinet approve a measure on July 3rd that
declared the measure taken on June 30th July 1st and 2nd to suppress treasonous
assaults are legal as acts of self-defense by the state Reich Justice
Minister France gerner a conservative who had been baravarian Justice minister in the years of the Ware Republic
demonstrated his loyalty to the new regime by drafting the statute which added illegal V near to The Purge signed
into law by Hitler gerner and the minister of the Interior wilham Frick the law regarding measures of State
self-defense retroactively legalized any murders committed by the Nazi party Germany's legal establishment further
capitulated to the regime when the country's leading legal scholar CW Schmidt wrote an article defending
Hitler it was named the fura upholds the law a special fund was set up for the
relatives of the murdered from which they were cared for at State cost the widows of the murdered sa leaders
received between 1,000 and 1,600 marks per month depending upon the rank of the
murdered person the relatives of Ernst Rome received
nothing part four the Mad Inquisitor with Rome dead and the sa
defeated himler and the SS soon emerged as the true Victors alongside Hitler
within a short time himler would preside over an Empire of death whose Mass
extermination factories would operate Around the Clock turning non-aryans into
Ash now he was the second most powerful man in the Third Reich and now like his
master he had the opportunity to realize his deepest obsessions his every whim
however perverse or murderous was regarded as law by his SS henchmen the
huge effort to Institute Hitler's final solution for the Jews of Europe would gradually consume his time and resources
the Jewish people however were not his only targets himler also turned his
sights on the gay community of Germany some said he'd concentrate more on the elimination of gay men if Hitler hadn't
been breathing down his neck about the so-called Jewish issue he was especially appalled by homosexuals who he was
determined to exterminate whether under the direct orders of Hitler or not in this he had only a partial success
his raging phobia which was responsible for a violent campaign against German homosexuals struck Terror in the hearts
of hundreds of thousands of gay men and killed thousands of others there have always been two
himr the colorless sickly bureaucrat hiding behind his towers of alphabetized
file cases staying up late to scrutinize the family trees of prospective SS
officers with a shape of Aryan skulls excavated in Tibet and then the ogre
the creator of the stunningly efficient gestapo machine the remote control Mass killer
ordering the elimination of entire populations without any visible sign of remorse the world perceived himler as
the butcher who ordered all Russian prisoners of War to be killed and as the man who organized the destruction of
Europe's Jewish population it was himler SS that set up and ran the concentration camps
beginning in 1933 with a few few criminals communist Catholics liberals socialist Jews Romani and gay men in
daau and then within 10 years had extended its network of Terror over more
than half of Europe it was himmler's order of the death's head that supervised the gassing of inmates in the
salvaging of gold fillings in their teeth to be deposited at the Federal Bank in Berlin by 1935 and 1936 when the
campaign against non-aryans including gay men began in Earnest himmler's officers were legally entitled to arrest
Suspects on any pretext for submission of crimes not committed and throw the victims into camps where they were
without legal recourse next to Reinhard hydrick Chief security officer who was
assassinated in 1942 himmler's name was the most feared throughout Germany and
the occupied territories His Image was that of a monster devoid of any shred of humanity
he did little to dispel that impression in October of 1943 for example he told
SS leader ERS assembled in posn and Poland what happens to the Russians what happens to the Cs is a matter of utter
indifference to me whether the other peoples live in Comfort or perish interests me only in so far as we need
them as slaves for our culture apart from that it is not interest me whether
or not 10,000 Russian women collapse from exhaustion while digging a tank ditch interests me only in so far as the
tank ditch is completed for Germany Germany himler said needed a national
sexual budget to compensate for the loss of more than a million of its soldiers in World War I Germany had experienced
the sharpest fall in the birth rate of All European nations hitting an extraordinary low in
1933 veneral diseases had spread throughout the country particularly among younger people in addition the
Republic had been afflicted by another illness according to estimates more than 2 million homosexuals had been living in
Germany himler made a quick calculation 2 million men killed or injured in the
last war plus 2 million homosexuals equal 4 million German women without husbands that he concluded was a
catastrophe for Germany it was even worse than the half million babies he estimated to have been
lost through abortion homosexuals himler emphasized corrupted other men making them
unwilling or unable to produce children if this Vice continues he warned it will
be the end of Germany a good race producing few children was destined to
be extinct in 200 years while nations with many children can gained Supremacy
and Mastery of the world sex therefore was a matter of public concern not a private Affair ancient Germany which he
claimed had always had masculine dominance knew this Germany's tonic
forbearers knew what to do with homosexuals they drowned them in bogs No it should not be called
punishment it was extermination of abnormal existence unfortunately for himler the
new Germany could not apply the same technique he did not say whether this was due to a scarcity of suitable bogs
but he would see to it that like stinging nettles we will rip them out throw them on a heap and burn them
otherwise if we continue to have this Vice predominant in Germany without being able to fight it we'll see the end
of Germany the end of the dramatic world part five it
begins when Hitler was appointed Chancellor on January 30th 1933
Victorious Nazi troops conducted huge marches stomping through the streets of Berlin chanting songs of Revenge Hitler
never managed to attain a majority of Voters neither in the German Parliament in the reichstag nor among the German
people the best the Nazi party could ever get was a plurality government by the March 5th election and they only
managed that by drumming up fears of a communist Uprising whether the Nazis really expected a communist Uprising or
whether as so often before they simply camouflaged violent action by ascribing them to their opponents Luck came to
their assistance on February 27th the reichstag or German Parliament went up
in Flames Hitler proclaimed this is a sign of Providence from above now nobody
will dare stand in our way when we crush the Communist Menace with our Iron Fist
immediately afterward a wave of Terror swept through Germany the first of many members of opposition parties found
themselves on benches in the Berlin Central police station similar arrests engulfed cities and Villages throughout
Germany the Nazis had started to settle accounts with their enemies when the jails proved not to be large enough
himler stepped in within less than a month he embarked on the construction of concentration camps beginning with
daau among the first to be jailed with the directors of homosexual rights organiz ations which had been made
illegal Just 4 days before the burning of the reichstag held's institute for sexual research was a prime target as
were CTT Hiller its chairman Felix Hall a legal adviser and Max hoden a
respected sex reformer whose books on Women's Rights sexual minorities and abortion had annoyed the Nazis for years
Hiller held's successor and most prominent member of The Institute was shipped to oranburg where he was
repeatedly tortured the offices of several prominent gay organizations were raided during these early winter weeks
of 1933 communist and Social Democratic papers were forced to stop printing the
Nazi propagandists never tired of conjuring up the smoldering debris the smoking wood piles the devastated
ceilings of the Reich she declared that this fire was only a beginning the
Communists they said had destroyed the parliament now they would unleash a civil war German citizens could expect
the worst Only the strongest government measures could save the nation those
strongest measures followed soon on March 24th the so-called enabling law
was adopted subtitled the law to remove the stress from people and state in
reality it did away with the Constitution removed all legal restraints and gave total control to
Hitler and his thugs it signaled the end of the Ware Republic in the start of the Nazi regime and it remained on the books
until 1945 the days that consumed the reichstag the later ransacking of held's
Institute and finally the notorious book burning on May 10th during which fanatical Stormtroopers destroyed the
works of those who had made German culture great but were now declared to be subhumans should have been seen as a
signal to every non-nazi the vast majority of Germans that the era of Tolerance and progress had abruptly come
to an end that a new Dark Age would follow yet most gays hoped that they
could weather the storm many rushed to join the Nazi party in the belief that they could vanish among the uniformed crowds others hoped for
the best and although bars and cafes catering to homosexuals were eliminated they tried to continue their lives as
unobtrusively as possible gradually many realized that their existence was threatened and they lived in constant
fear of Discovery others joined the Armed Forces over which the gapo was never to gain complete jurisdiction but
not until Rome and his Confederates were executed did most homosexuals believed that a country like Germany could fall
back into barbarism now however there could be no mistaking the murderous intentions of the Nazis there could be
no doubt any longer that the Nazis were as violently opposed to homosexuals as they were to Jews and
roma a flood of rules and memorandums were soon issued by the Minister of Justice in the headquarters of Berlin's
gestapo aiming both to micromanage German sex lives and to expand the criminal class the still modest gusto o
of himler sent a secret circular letter for instance to the police headquarters throughout Germany on the 24th of
October 1934 they were told to mail lists of all somehow homosexual active persons
alleged crimes against paragraph 175 had been used from the beginning as a ruse to prosecute individuals whose politics
displeased those in power charges were quickly concocted for homosexual acts an
ex-convict who could be persuaded to swear that her X had fondled why could
always be found by the authorities on June 8th 1935 paragraph 175 was revised
to extend the concept of criminally indecent activities between men it permitted the authorities to arrest any
male on the most ludicrous and transparent charges from the beginning courts and judges took it upon
themselves to decide what in their minds constituted criminal indecency this meant that previous interpretations of
paragraph 175 as outlying only actions resembling kidus were now seen as too
narrow mutual masturbation was declared a felony a kiss or a touch could be interpreted as criminally
indecent the specialists in the ministry of Justice were not satisfied until
anything that could remotely be considered as sex between men was labeled a transgression himler was
forced to briefly abandon the attack in August of 1936 some gay bars were allowed to
reopen and the police were ordered not to mess with foreign homosexuals during the Olympic games in
Berlin the repre ended quickly though once the Olympics
ended part six legally admissible on October 26th the Federal
Security Department for combating abortion and homosexuality was established in the Berlin gestapo
headquarters headed up by the SS Captain formerly in charge of redistributing goods that had been stolen from Jewish
people by 1936 the traditional more conservative police agencies had been
federalized which meant that himler ruled virtually unchallenged more leeway was given to
prosecutors while defense attorneys and judges lost control the factual proof
laws were abolished sentencing relied not only on the seriousness of the alleged criminal act but also on the
quote psychological form of which the defendant was alleged to belong therefore persons convicted of
sexual deviance had no chance of escaping prosecution in a Nazi Court the
newly formulated laws had also been made retroactive a Jewish man for example
could be imprisoned in 1936 for having had an affair with a non-jewish woman in
1933 before the crime of racial defilement was defined the same was true for homosexual
activities the ministry of Justice soon issued new guidelines stating that homosexual offenses
did not actually have to be committed to be punishable intent was enough for the
courts whether real or perceived later courts decided that a lewd glance from
one man to another was sufficient grounds for prosecution in 1937 a young lawyer named
Rudolph Clare wrote a book homosexuality and criminal law it provided the
ideological under pittings for the war on homosexuals with cla's book SS officers
in charge of indoctrination could explain to the often ignorant members of the community how their natural healthy
instincts would be affected by sexual deviance the revision of paragraph 175
had not banned sexual acts Between Women Claire sought to correct this oversight
he pleaded to make gross indecencies between women as punishable as those between
men marriage and childbearing he wrote were the two main pillars on which
Nordic racial Heritage was based Nazi J ists ignored cla's please and himler
seemed never to have made any statement about lesbians nevertheless some albe at very
few german lesbians were caught in the Machinery of the secret police little was known of their fate though some were
tried and imprisoned with PS the Nazis hoping that they would be raped by French and Russian prisoners in
fact the PS were promised a special reward for each Act of aggression a
bottle of schnaps but disappointing the Nazis the PS did
not violate their fellow prisoners though According to some reports they
were not so kind to the German guards once the Americans and Russians reached their prisons one group that emerged
untouched were some of Germany's most prominent and open homosexuals artists
who had obtained the protection of high Nazi officials sometimes even Hitler himself
reported ly after a long conversation with himler Hitler advised that actors and other artists could be arrested for
offenses against paragraph 175 only with his personal consent still
the flood of anti-homosexual injunctions kept Rising on April 4th 1938 the Berlin
gestapo issued a new directive a man accused of gross indecency with another
man could be transferred directly to a camp without trial up until then gay men had been
serving time in prison the camps though were something else
entirely but himler soon found himself the topic of mockery as more and more
people began to realize that the SS was becoming dominated by gay men leadership positions were teeming
with homosexuals and it was an Open Secret among many in Germany that if a man were to offer sexual favors to an SS
officer most any crime could be forgiven and so on November 15th 1941 himler
issued the fur's decree relating to Purity in the SS and police henceforth
any SS or police officer engaging in indecent Behavior with another man or allowing himself to be abused by him for
indecent purposes was to be condemned to death after the Russians had retaken
Stalingrad himler advised the Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff that his bureau held jurisdiction over Soldiers and
Sailors con victed of same seex indecencies as well though homosexual acts among German men did not cease it
seems that himler was forced to pay attention to more pressing matters than what gay men did in their spare
time part seven is he you
know how did the Nazis identify homosexuals not easily gays were
difficult to find unlike Jews and Romani whose religious or racial background s were regularly noted on their birth
certificates and unlike Communists socialists and social Democrats whose politics could be decided by a glance at
the membership roles of their parties there were no clear documents or physical identification for homosexuals
the Central Bureau of the Berlin criminal police which had collected lists of around 20 to 30,000 homosexuals
in Germany in 1897 was the only exception himler was given a head start
by the practice of keeping track of as many future undesirables as possible any
men who may seem flamboyant even in teenage years and the development of a
massive documentation system the names gained by the first large scale arrests following the Rome Purge were added to
the Aging list from 1897 not only sa members but civilians
found in gay bars or clubs were also noted pressure was imposed on victims to condemn others under torture names of
friends and lovers were extracted and himmler's list grew longer occasionally bartenders who were not particularly
sympathetic to their gay clientele would have names to give one book of addresses
led to another one name to the next the gay community being used
against itself fortunately hersfeld scientific humanitarian committee had destroyed its membership rosters in time
but it is not known if the larger organization the Friendship League managed to get rid of its archives early
enough in addition how is it possible for a suspect to prove that he had not
thrown another man an offensive glance a man was arrested in at least one case
not because he had been caught having sex with another man but because he was simply glancing at more men than women
still many gay men managed to avoid detection by the authorities survival
depended on either the suspension of one's sex life or its successful pursuit in secret often Anonymous encounters
conducted at considerable risk three special programs were launched against homosexuals in Germany and its new
satellite States the intent was to use the charge of homosexuality as a pretext to rid the
Nazi party of suspected opponents these campaigns were directed against the youth movement the Catholic church and
the armed forces the first was organized by balder Von shirro an aristocratic Drifter
partly American by descent who had met Hitler in the early 1920s and won his confidence by 1931 sherro held the
Reigns of the Hitler Youth firmly in his hands he was determined to dissolve the
competing youth groups to get rid of their leaders and to push their charges into joining the Hitler Youth in 1941
Shiro's office issued a manual on the behavior of the young part statistics part indoctrination document part
prescription for action against violators of the sexual and behavioral code of the Hitler Youth the need to do
so suggest ests that not all members of the Hitler Youth were always able to conform to the code of Nordic Purity and
righteousness it was entitled criminality and delinquency of Youth
once again homosexuality was defined as a dangerous contagious epidemic the Ware
Republic was accused of standing by quote while this epidemic spread everywhere and even criminal statistics
did not bother with registering it the book concedes that not all adolescent
sexual behaviors are indicative of real or compulsive homosexuality often out of
sheer curiosity young people take to Collective masturbation nevertheless it quickly contributes to quote genuine
perversion and the leaders were primarily engaged in the seduction of younger males in the free youth orders
this as they grew older LED their victims to similar homosexual crimes thus these sex crimes spread further and
further like an epidemic according to sta statistics compiled by the Nazis and discovered after the war's end there
were roughly 2.4 million teenage boys who are arrested under various charges
yet only 25,000 of those cases were crimes against paragraph 175 and of that
only 3,976 were convicted essentially 47 out
of every 10,000 this was embarrassing sherro like himler was convinced that
gays formed a greater portion of the criminal population still more embarrassing proved to be a second
inquiry into samesex felonies within the Hitler Youth 15% of upper management
shero's closest confidence had been discovered committing homosexual acts and the organization HIIT it from public
view in fact gays in most parts of the Nazi military machine were excused when
caught having gay sexual encounters but not all of them were so lucky to
understand what happened to the gay men in the armed forces who did not quote pass that is is those who were caught
and convicted three factors must be taken into account first after July 1935
as draft age gays began to grasp the ferocity of the new anti-homosexual laws many decided to volunteer for the Navy
Army or the Air Force neither the generals of the army Admirals of the Navy nor even Marshall Goring of the Air
Force shared the homophobic obsessions of himler second after the Rome Purge had
eliminated the homosexual sa Elite no halfway intelligent G person was likely to join the homophobic SS though many
had already made it in right under himmler's nose third none of the Armed
Forces were inclined favorably toward homosexuality statistics from 1940 show
that the military courts were busy with sexual offenders as more and more young men joined or were drafted
simultaneously indictments of male civilians for the same felonies stayed the same or dropped slightly in 1942
after much badgering from himler Hitler declared that the armed forces were too lenient in their treatment of sexual
deviant to his disappointment accused gay soldiers continued to
serve it was 1943 after all the Russians were advancing the Americans had joined
the war and Germany had bigger problems than nice Aryan boys having sex with each
other part eight Camp as you can see gay men even in Nazi
Germany had a habit of slipping through the net that was set up to catch homosexuals but not everyone was so
lucky the first concentration camp to open daa began operation on March 30th
1933 on himmler's orders set up in haste to relieve the prisons which were
overcrowded after the rag fire the camp was poorly organized the sa arrested and
sometimes discharged people at random the earliest prisoners included anti-fascists Catholics homosexuals and
Jews the commandant major Hillmar vur attempted to maintain some order violent
insubordination and incitement to Disobedience were punishable by death
still he could not keep his constables in check himler angered by the adverse publicity generated by the murder of
several prisoners dismiss vakal who was subsequently charged by the Bavarian criminal prosecutor's office in June
1933 himler appointed Theodore Ike the man who more than anything else shaped
the character not not only of daau but of concentration camps in general he organized brutality courses for the SS
novices worked out a graded system of confinements and succeeded in turning the newly born order of the death's head
into a fanatical gang of bullies imbued with hatred toward the charges they regarded as subhuman Ike's favorite
slogan frequently shouted by the guards at newcomers was there are enough German oak trees to hang anybody who dares defy
us it was Ike who transformed akow from a disorderly openair jail into a place
of carefully calibrated punishment and deprivation schedules it was Ike Who provided the model for all later
institutions men trained under him often ended up as high officers in the larger camps and it was Ike who brought the
revolver into Ernst Rome's prison cell and when Rome refused the proferred suicide shot him on Hitler's orders thus
bringing to a climax the night of the Long Knives whether Ikes governing techniques
stemmed from his experience as police Informer terrorist and SS officer or whether they simply mirrored the mind of
a butcher born to the task a bully who enjoyed tyrannizing others remains
difficult to decide what is incontestable is that it was his policies that shaped The Contours of all
camps and made them into the indispensable and diabolical instruments of Hitler and himmler's rule by Terror
Ike developed a set of procedures that would breed in the guards a conviction that they were not only carrying out legitimate orders but punishing
dangerous subversives his brutality Training Academy graduates ruled over almost all later penal institutions
first those in the west later in the extermination Mills in the east in his
guide book on discipline and Order his training drills for the Misfits and malens who made up his armies Ike
created a nightmarish world of barbarism and doom so far removed from the experience of most western Nations that
what went on inside the camps was at first not even believed the camps thanks
to himler existed outside any legal restrictions they presented a new type of penal colony where anybody resisting
the established order could be quickly silenced the entire process of dehumanization upon entering the camps
the stripping in some cases the Shaving of all hair the loss of name and personhood caused profound trauma it was
accompanied not only by the enduring sensation of powerlessness the victim under d daily assault in one way or
another also began to realize that nothing he had achieved done or owned counted here but what was the fate of
gay men in the Camp's Nether world how did a homosexual newcomer fit into the
institutional system set up by the SS to dominate the prisoners and how did he fit into the counter mechanism produced
to survive after a gay man had arrived at the camp he had the worst Encounter of all the newcomers a profound trauma
seized him he was battered slapped beaten vilified homosexuals and Jews were given
not only the worst beatings according to Witnesses but their pubic hair was shorn
others lost only the hair on their head a clergyman remanded to daau in September of 1941 described the process
the SS man asked everybody What charges he had been sentenced one man was there on account
of crimes against paragraph 175 he was cuffed forced to tell in
detail what he had done and how then they fell upon Him cuffing and
kicking another victim recalls his first day when my name was called I stepped
forward gave my name and mentioned paragraph 175 with the words you filthy queer get
over there you [ __ ] I received several kicks then
was transferred to an SS sergeant in charge of my block the first first thing I got from
him was a violent blow to my face that threw me to the ground he brought his knees up hard into my groin so that I
doubled over in pain he grinned at me and said that was your entrance
fee another witness testified about his reception at a camp I can swear an oath that because of
my triangle I was separated from other inmates an SS Sergeant together with AO
mistreated me in the most brutal manner three times their fists hit my face
especially my nose so that I fell on the floor three times when I managed to get up again
they continued battering and hitting me I then staggered back to my Barracks
covered with blood survivors have maintained the pink triangles they were forced to wear to
signify their reason for imprisonment were always larger than those of other colors even the yellow stars of David
Camp officials made sure of this as to make them easy targets among other Camp
victims in dhau gay people were kept apart from other inmates Rudolph hes a
dhau official at the time explained in his Memoirs that he had ordered homosexuals isolated to make it easier
to control them has also developed the Salvation through work Theory which he
tried out on gay men in aitz it was intended to make the quote depraved
deviant work so hard that they nearly collapsed from exhaustion this it was hoped would quote
straighten them out Hess admitted it never worked hess's
directives to keep homosexuals strictly controlled apart from all other prisoners was followed in several camps
One Survivor writes of hess's methods alock was occupied by
homosexuals with about 250 men in each wing we would sleep only in our night
shirts had to keep our hands outside the blankets the windows had several layers
of ice on them anyone found in bed with his underclothes on or his hands under
the blankets there were several checks every night was taken outside and had several
buckets of water poured over him before being left standing in the cold for a
good hour only a few people survived this treatment
the least result was bronchitis and it was rare for any homosexual taken into the Sick Bay to come out
alive what put gay men into a low if not the lowest category of prisoner were
several factors H for example insisted on sequestering the gays sealed off in their Barracks they could not fraternize
with the anti-fascist underground which hn occupied key Camp positions like himler hes seems to have
been convinced that most homosexuals were intellectually above average thus they might serve as useful allies to the
dangerous anti-fascist power block within the camp H also believed that
homosexuality was an illness that might spread to other inmates or even to the
guards there appears to have been an additional Dee rooted Dogma at work that doomed efforts by gay men to associate
with anyone but each other Hess insisted albe it wrongfully that even if they
were in poor physical shape they always had to indulge their Vice it wasn't only
hes and other SS rulers who presumed that homosexuals always had sex on their minds and were forever bent on seducing
heterosexuals the straight inmates themselves also tended to regard gays as men for whom nothing was more important
than their genitalia after all that was why they were jailed that was what distinguished
them from all other prisoners in the camps with no women Pres present even the political prisoners worried that the
situation offered the gays too many opportunities to approach sex starved males such contact in turn was likely to
lead to private relationships perhaps even with copos or guards which might
endanger the solidarity of the anti-fascist Coalition thus when gay and mate tried
to join a clandestine Camp committee they were rejected both Nazi overseers
and their prisoners looked down on the men with the the pink triangles and sought to make their lives as miserable
as possible there were additional factors complicating the lives of gay prisoners a few SSG guards Were Gay
although they risked everything they made some younger inmates usually polish or Russians their quote Dolly boys they
would also occasionally compete with copos for these teenagers they even Drew lots to determine who should go to whom
naturally it enraged the other inmates to watch as these youngers received extra food rations and were Exempted
from tough work assignments in exchange for sexual favors there were also some SS guards who took special pleasure in
occasionally masturbating while torturing prisoners for such acts the
gay inmates were held accountable by the non-gay inmates homosexual guards however
hostile were seen by non-gay prisoners as belonging to the homosexual underclass in the camp thus gay
prisoners were often tainted by the crimes of the gay guards even though they themselves were
victims of them cooperation among homosexuals in the camps was rare unlike
hardcore criminals the anti-fascists and the Romani the gays came from such widely disperate backgrounds that group
solidarity was hard to achieve Eugene kogan who survived six years in buen
Wald as a political prisoner went on to write the still classic account of the camp experience the theory and practice
of hell he confirms that the lives of gay men were made especially terrible
this group had a very heterogeneous composition it included individuals of real value in addition to large numbers
of criminals and especially blackmailers this made the position of the group as a whole very
precarious homosexual practices were actually very widespread in the camps
the prisoners however ostracized only Those whom the SS marked with the pink triangle the fate of the homosexuals in
the concentration camps can only be described as ghastly they were often segregated in
special barracks and work details such segregation offered ample
opportunity to unscrupulous elements in positions of power to engage in extortion and
maltreatment in shipments to extermination camps such as Nord Housen nutzer and gross Rosen they furnished
the highest proportionate share if anything could save them at all it was
to enter into sorted relationships within the camp but this was as likely to endanger their lives as to save
them theirs was an insoluble predicament and virtually all of them
perished in the life of every prisoner connections to the outside world played a vital role many survivors remember
bitterly how the SS constables together with corrupt copos stole packages or rifled through them and how they
withheld mail at a whim or as punishment still a few parcels and letters managed
to slip through to the jailers the incoming male of an inmate meant that he had contacts possibly with officials who
might exert pressure or pay money to work at a transfer or even a discharge most homosexuals however were
cut off from contacts with the outside world very few families seem to have been willing to stand by sons Brothers
husbands or other relatives accused of crimes against paragraph 175 few gay
friends would dare to establish communication when such a gesture might endanger their own precarious
existence in the climate of Terror that the Nazis had created even direct relatives close friends or former lovers
hesitated to contact homosexual prisoners many gay men in Camp anxious to avoid entangling others sought to
never initiate contact with the outside world to keep safe the people they loved
they allowed concent rtion camps to become their entire world perhaps the
most feared fate for gay men in the camps was to be labeled a medical experiment Eugene kogan has concluded
that again the number of homosexuals used for these pseudo medical undertakings was disproportionately
large consider the hormone experiments administered in buken Wald by the Danish endrocrinologist Carl veret thet used
homosexual inmates exclusively these experiments brought illness and death to the subjects and
had no scientific value injecting men with random concoctions of chemicals to
see how the body would react massive amounts of hormones to send the body into shock in one such experiment gay
men were injected with a hormone mixture that made them almost impervious to pain and so they were used as target practice
in the yard strapped to posts inevitably they would die of blood loss or organ
failure if not once the injections wore off and the pain hit they would go into
shock and die in late 1944 new experiments were commissioned these
would test the calcium levels of men before and after castration once again only gay men were
used for the experiment results showed a mix of normal to lower levels and all
men with lower levels were executed veret was forced to stop his tests
because of the danger of a yellow fever epidemic in the camp the epidemic was not a result of infection from outside
sources though such as prisoners of war from the East instead it was because he
had wanted to see the progression of yellow fever on human beings again only gay test subjects and failed to properly
quarantine them many prisoners and some guards died veret quickly returned to Prague
but his name appears again in the files for a camp near Hamburg where he attempted to repeat his castration and
hormone tests these documents do not State whether he actually finished them in other camps
gay men were used as test subjects to see how long a person could survive underwater without drowning dehydration experiments high
altitude simulations freezing and being used as test subjects for new chemical weapons of
war but only at booken Wald were gay men used
exclusively part nine does it end
most of the victims of the Holocaust were freed after the war was over most the Americans and Soviets
helped to free them and tried to restore Germany to order and safety prisoners tried to find surviving family members
and go back to their hometowns it was disorienting after being in the camps for so long and
seeing all of the horrors to go back to a world that did not yet know what had
happened let alone understand however the home sexual prisoners were liberated from the camps only to face more
discrimination since they were technically in the concentration camps because of a supposed crime they had
committed they were sometimes put into German prisons after they got out of the camps others were sent to Soviet prison
camps in the north paragraph 175 had been on the book since 1871 and so the Supreme Court of
Germany ruled in 1957 the paragraph 175 still stood since it was not a law made
by the Nazis as noted paragraph 175 was strengthened by the Nazis and made into
a more strict version of the law so homosexuals were more persecuted during
the Nazi regime than before and in a much more brutal way however the courts
did not recognize this the Nazi version of paragraph 175 was kept on the books
in Germany until 1969 it was the only Nazi law to not be
immediately overturned one man recalls that he was repeatedly arrested under paragraph 1175
throughout the 1950s and 60s while other prisoners were trying to make sense of what had happened and rebuild their
lives and families homosexual prisoners just faced more discrimination and hardships and imprisonment survivors
often had to lie about why they were in the camps and keep quiet about their experience prisoners who were in
specifically homosexual barracks or had had experiments done on them often did not feel like they could share their
experiences one man was in the concentration camps for over 8 Years yet when he was released he went
right back to work in his family store between he and his mother his time in the camps was
unspoken it was shameful not the abuse that had been done to his body and mind nor the
traumas and trials that he had survived but the fact fact that he was a
homosexual his Gauntlet of suffering perceived as nothing more than simply enduring the consequences for committing
a crime this was a common theme between many of the gay survivors of the
Holocaust shamed into silence the Nazis aimed to eradicate or re-educate
homosexuals and as professor lotman of the University of Breman put it the
re-education towards heterosexuality was somewhat achieved by the collective Silence of gay
victims the world fought for justice for the victims of Hitler's Holocaust but not for gay people Justice
for the men beaten and tortured in the camps was not a priority and most politicians were not
shy to say that when it came to gay people
many wished that Hitler had finished the job part
10 remember in the 1990s after the fall of
the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany more LGBT rights groups and gay survivors of the Holocaust began
demanding an official memorial for the gay victims of the Nazi death machine there were already many memorials for
the other groups persecuted by the Nazis however none for gay people other survivors were not comfortable including
homosexuals in their memorials and so they remained forgotten by history some
Memorial started off as guilla memorials where gay rights groups would go and place wreaths at the concentration camps
recognizing the gay victims one gay rights group actually got permission to put a memorial with a pink triangle and
the inscription beaten to death silenced to death at Mosen concentration camp
this Memorial not only speaks to the treatment of the gay victims within the camps but also the continued silence
that happened afterward other memorials to the the victims began to be approved by the German State over time multiple
camps started to put up Memorial plaques at the sites of the homosexual Barracks most notably the one in buken Walt other
countries like the Netherlands had memorials put up much earlier than in Germany in 2003 one of Germany's largest
and most well-known memorials to gay victims was approved and was finished in
2008 officially called the National Memorial for the homosexual victims of the Holocaust it is a large large
concrete block standing 12T tall constructed in the teargarden it has a
small window in it which allows visitors to catch a glimpse of a video containing two men having to meet and share a
secret kiss in the exact Woods where the memorial is located there is very little
that indicates this is a memorial to the homosexual Holocaust Survivors a small plaque and the video
are the only Clues this was intentional however because the Creator ators of the
memorial wanted it to be like someone was just randomly happening upon this clandestine
relationship they wanted to show the secrecy surrounding homosexual relationships and how a simple kiss
could land you in trouble by being placed in the tear goon and not well-labeled the monument is a testament
to the continued shame and secrecy that the homosexual victims faced even after
the Holocaust ended upon encountering the memorial visitors are faced with watching a
same-sex encounter and have to deal with their own feelings and potential prejudices about the video
displayed in this way the memorial is continually challenging
homophobia and honoring the continued victimization of homosexuals it has been
estimated that over 50,000 men were arrested under paragraph 175 in Germany
of these men it's estimated around 15,000 were murdered in the camps and
any number in prison prisons earlier exact numbers cannot be known because
the Nazis burned many of their records when they knew their end was near many prisoners were quickly liquidated
without accurate documentation of their deaths and so many historians believe that these numbers are vastly
underestimated before the Nazis came to power Germany was experiencing more sexual Liberation than anywhere on Earth
especially in Berlin these golden 20s were cut short by the Nazis who strengthened paragraph 175 and started
to persecute more and more homosexuals and other men who they just believed to be gay they raided and
burned Magnus held's Institute of sexual research gay men were thrown into separate barracks in the camps and
forced to do some of the most excruciating labor often resulting in death and were often seen as the lowest
of the prisoners even by others in the camps they often had experiments done to them that affected them shamed them or
killed them after the Holocaust homosexual victims were shamed into silence the gay victims
of the Holocaust deserve respect and recognition their voices should be heard and their stories taught alongside the
other victims of Hitler's Purge if we continue to ignore or silence their voices we are letting the
Nazis win in many ways the specters of the Third Reich still haunt
us the specters begin to come to life whenever Fanatics of any sect try to
take over a nation and call for a war against its most vulnerable and vilified
minorities since the end of World War II in the discovery of the Nazi death machine every Modern Nation across the
globe has spoken the same mantras it could never happen
here and never again Western Nations have decried
countries as backwards when they begin murdering giant portions of their own populations Jewish people Muslims racial
minorities and ethnic groups but when gay people are being arrested hung shot
drowned and decapitated in countries like Iran Saudi Arabia Somalia Chia Russia Syria
Uganda our political leaders our Representatives Fain offense but do
nothing about it they may threaten sanctions but no one will go to war to
save the gays and so we have to save ourselves we have to do what we can to
get gay men and women and trans people out of countries that would see them murdered by the state get them away from
vicious leaders who would rather see them riddled with bullets than holding
hands we must learn the lessons that were taught in Europe and then we must mean
it we must act when we say
never
again

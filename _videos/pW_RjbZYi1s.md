Hollywood, despite the best efforts of executives and studio heads, has been gay since the day it was born. In this video we'll explore the first seventy years of Tinsel Town's not-so-private closet. From silent film and federal investigations to the golden age of coding and the rise of out and proud queer cinema.

Over the last several years there have been demands for more LGBTQ represention in Hollywood movies. But something that many people don’t know is that the first movie to ever win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, was also the first major Hollywood film to show a gay kiss.

tradespeople that helped turn Hollywood from a backwater orange grove in California to the city in which thousands of young dreamers make their way each year in hopes of becoming a star. It’s a long story. And like most classic American tales… it actually doesn’t begin in America at all.

These stupid titles are impossible to read because the font is so thin, spaced out, miniscule, and white over yellow most of the time. If I had to suffer, so should you, muahahaha.

Also, this is the only "movie" that Telos Pictures ever put its branding on.

> **Royce:** [...] there was a later Telos Productions credit roll type of thing that, again, had these 15 Founders on it, and I assume that that poster was made before you made that Twitter thread criticizing [the Ace video](7a4DTkoejG8) and that this later video happened afterwards, because our names were removed.
> 
> **Courtney:** [...] it was for the video titled, “The History of Gay Hollywood.” [...] he gives this little introduction, and the credits start rolling, and it says “Telos Pictures Presents” and it has, like, Telos Executive Producers. Um, our name isn’t on there. Our name is not on there. We’re gone.
> 
> **Courtney:** So, one of two things happened. Either he just outright removed *our* names because of how viciously we attacked him last year, or he didn’t even look at the people who donated to him on Telos and he just input, like, some of his Patrons, from, like, his highest tier Patreon or something. Either way, you’re putting this on your YouTube video saying “Telos Pictures Presents,” and *excuse me, sir,* but we are Telos *Founders*, we are Telos *Executive Producers*, we *paid* for that *right*, and you are not *crediting us?* Interesting. Interesting. Not that I want my name to be associated with plagiarized content, but *interesting*.

## Chapter One - The Birth of Gay Hollywood

<compare>
<james meta fade=out {% include timecode %} id="title-out">

The love that dared not speak its name in *America* was surprisingly fluent when speaking German throughout the silent era of film. While America was using its new toy to glorify the Old West, recreating the fading dreams of its own mythology,

General American audiences though could easily see through the coding. However, it wasn’t long before the easily read coding... was forced to become almost, if not completely illegible.

## Chapter Two - The Invisible Men

<compare>
<james meta fade=out {% include timecode %} id="ch2-in">

In Hollywood's early years, homosexuality found its way on screen in ways both secret *and* obvious to the filmmakers behind the camera. Audiences *rarely* pushed back against these depictions, but those who *did* were loud, if not legion. Women's suffrage groups and the Catholic Church were the most dedicated to removing gay and lesbian content from Hollywood movies.

By December of that year 4,954 suspected homosexuals had been removed from employment in the federal government. The Lavender Scare was gripping Washington, and with the help of a future president, would soon dig its claws deep into Hollywood as well.

## Chapter Three - Black Listed

<compare>
<james meta fade=out {% include timecode %} id="ch3-in">

In the early 20th century, the United States experienced a period of political persecution and anxiety known as the "Red Scare". There were two different eras in American history that are collectively known as the Red Scare, both of which were marked by widespread anxiety over communism and other leftist ideas.

But even with deep *deep* coding... there was a catch anyone confirmed to be gay or even heavily coded to be... wouldn't have it easy. And to live a life true to themselves they might just have to die for it.

## Chapter Four - Dying to be Gay

<compare>
<james meta fade=out {% include timecode %} id="ch4-in">

As the film industry moved away from suburban perfection, the extensive efforts made by Hollywood to conceal homosexuality in film during the post-war Lavender Scare era began to deteriorate. And then Hollywood came to realize that they were ignoring a large audience. No, not gays.

gay people to the attention of the general public, and then the gay inclusive x-rated *Midnight Cowboy* won the Oscar for Best Picture, the norms surrounding the depiction of gay characters in film began to disintegrate. Gay people could now exist in Hollywood. But for how long?

## Chapter Five - A Crack in the Closet

<compare>
<james meta fade=out {% include timecode %} id="ch5-in">

*The *Boys in the Band** is a 1970 American film directed by William Friedkin of *Exorcist* fame, based on the 1968 Off-Broadway play of the same name by Mark Crowley. The film takes place in New York City in 1968, and follows a group of gay friends who gather for a birthday party.

But in that same summer... a rare cancer began appearing in gay men, followed by a cluster of pneumocystis pneumonia cases in San Francisco and New York. And then gay men across the world began dying. And suddenly *Hollywood's* opinion of us... didn't matter so much.

a seemingly random blog that my browser (and those of several of my friends) immediately flags as suspicious

Congressional Investigations and the Lavender Scare Summer 2016, Vol. 48, No. 2 By Judith Adkins Enlarge On December 15, 1950, the Hoey committee released this report, concluding that homosexuals were "unsuitable for employment in the Federal Government" and constituted "security risks in positions of public trust."

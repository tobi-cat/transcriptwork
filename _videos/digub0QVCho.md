Hey guys. I'm just in the process of editing the video that you're about to watch, and I thought I would drop a *severe* content warning right here. It's... it's a lot. Obviously, there's discussion of the murder of queer people. That's what the video's about. But there's also instances of audio that was taken from the killers, one of which they consistently refer to a trans woman as "he." I've made sure to keep any kind of deadnaming or anything like that out of there.

But I just wanted you to know that that's there. There's some violent shots. There's some, a couple of kind of brutal images as well, because I really wanted to get the point across. So, you know, if you feel like you need to take a break watching it or anything like that, by all means. Oh, also, for a lot of the victims, there's not a lot of pictures of them.

In early February 2008, in Oxnard, California, a 15 year old named Larry asked a fellow eighth grader named Brandon to be their valentine. Somehow, our society had given Brandon the impression that this innocent request was tantamount to a criminal offense. And so on February 12th, Brandon murdered Larry, shooting them twice in the back of the head. The first trial ended in a mistrial with several members of the jury agreeing with the defense's use of queer panic, stating that by Larry coming on to Brandon, they were essentially bullying him, leaving him with no choice but to kill the 15 year old.

On February 12th, an openly gay 15-year-old boy named Larry who was an eighth-grader in Oxnard, California was murdered by a fellow eighth-grader named Brandon. Larry was killed because he . . . was gay. Days before he was murdered, Larry asked his killer to be his Valentine . . . . And somewhere along the line the killer Brandon got the message that it’s so threatening and so awful and so horrific that Larry would want to be his Valentine that killing Larry seemed to be the right
thing to do. And when the message out there is [that it is] so horrible . . . to be gay you can be killed for it, we need to change the message.

The queer panic, or better known as gay or trans panic, defense has been a legal defense tactic for three quarters of a century in the United States and abroad. The murder of Larry in 2008 is just a recent and particularly venomous example and may actually fall under both gay and trans panic. Though Larry presented as a boy, many people who knew them stated after their death that they wanted to change their name to Latisha and possibly transition.

We won't know if Larry would have ever done that, though, because they only spent 15 years on this earth before rabid hatred took them from us all. I wish Larry was the only example of this. I wish queer panic was an obscure mention in a dusty legal book somewhere. But there's a sad, dark histoy to this rationalization of hate masquerading as a legal defense.

<mark>The use of queer panic in murder cases has its roots in theories of latent homosexuality as a mental disorder. The term homosexual panic was coined by Dr. Edward Kempf, a clinical psychiatrist, in 1920. After treating many patients who exhibited similar characteristics, Kempf came to the conclusion that certain troubled individuals who thought of themselves as heterosexuals were actually latent homosexuals. These individuals suffered from an internal conflict between their feelings of attraction to people of the same sex and societal views of such feelings as perverse. They also experienced a heightened sense of anxiety in same sex environments, caused by this tension.</mark>

He then placed a sensor on the penises of all the participants, and measured penile response to erotic videotapes involving heterosexuals, lesbians, and gay men engaging in sexual activity. Only the men in Adams’s homophobic category showed an increase in penile erection in response to male homosexual erotic stimuli.<sup>49</sup>

Kempf's study has since been used to back up the use of the queer panic defense that latent homosexuality is in and of itself a mental disorder, therefore excusing the defendant as being not in control of their own faculties. By using the gay panic defense, they are essentially admitting to be latently queer themselves. A nuance many of the defendants, I'm sure, are unaware of.

Even if some self-identified straight men who express strongly negative feelings about homosexuality are actually latent homosexuals repressing their own homoerotic desires, the idea that gay panic should excuse the killing of a gay man is problematic for several reasons. First, treating gay panic as a mental disorder suggests that homophobia<sup>50</sup> linked to latent homosexuality is a mental illness.<sup>51</sup> Studies, however, indicate that negative attitudes about homosexuality tend to come from two sources: sexual conservatism and prejudice.<sup>52</sup> Although some mental health practitioners might feel otherwise,<sup>53</sup> sexually conservative individuals and prejudiced individuals are not necessarily mentally ill.

</from>
<comment> 

James seems to be taking the "latent homosexuality is a mental illness" fragment and running with it. First of all, that wasn't Kempf's study, it was Henry Adams' study, Kempf just had theories based on his practice. Second of all, the study, which was from 1996, has not been used to argue that "latent homosexuality is a mental illness," because homosexual panic and homosexuality have not been considered mental disorders, at least in the DSM, since the early 70s. [Homosexual panic, as a disorder, and the homosexual panic defense, are distinct, because a person using the homosexual panic defense is typically arguing *temporary* insanity (or provocation or self defense), not that they have a mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense#Use_of_the_gay_panic_defense). I guess you *could* argue that people who use the gay panic defense are admitting to being latently queer, based on the term's origin, but that's really a stretch, and it's pretty homophobic to imply that everyone who uses the gay panic defense is gay themselves. Or maybe he's just saying it's ironic that a heterosexual homophobe is accidentally admitting to being gay, I don't know.

Gay panic in and of itself is a useless defense. It must be attached to something more meaty, something you can win over a jury with. 

<mark>Excuse or justification. [Title card with A|Excuse or justification appears.]</mark> <mark>An excuse defense is one in which the defendant's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but that he himself is not seen as morally at fault. A justification defense, on the other hand, focuses on the defendant's conduct more than his individual characteristics. A justification defense argues that the attacker's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.</mark>

<mark>*A. Excuse or Justification?*</mark>

A preliminary question is whether gay panic, if allowed as a defense argument, should be recognized as an excuse or a justification. An excuse defense is one in which the actor’s conduct is viewed as wrongful, but the actor himself is not seen as morally blameworthy.<sup>75</sup> A justification defense, in contrast, focuses on the actor’s conduct more than the individual characteristics of the actor.<sup>76</sup> A justification defense says the actor’s conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.<sup>77</sup> Examples of excuse defenses include insanity, duress, and intoxication. Necessity, self-defense, and defense of others are usually considered justification defenses.

<footer>

No, attorneys have to argue excuse or justification, or they're not going to get anywhere with a gay panic defense. The text literally says that out of the gay panic defense arguments, "provocation is a partial excuse defense, self-defense is a justification defense, and insanity and diminished capacity are excuse defenses."

Diminished capacity, a partial defense to murder, generally requires proof that the defendant was acting under the influence of a mental disease or defect which affected his capacity to premeditate and deliberate or form the requisite intent to kill.</mark> There are two variants of the diminished capacity defense. Under the mens rea variant, “evidence that [the defendant] suffered from a mental disease or defect at the time of his conduct is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that he lacked a mental state that is an element of the charged offense.”<sup>103</sup> Under the partial responsibility variant, the charge is reduced from murder to manslaughter because the defendant is seen as “less blameworthy and therefore less deserving of punishment, than a killer who acts with a normal state of mind.”<sup>104</sup>

James changes first-degreee to second-degree, presumably because the Medium article says "he pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter." I looked but I couldn't find which one he actually pleaded. I suspect it was first-degree manslaughter because it makes more sense from what I read about New York laws; second-degree manslaughter, also caused reckless homicide, is when you unintentionally cause someone else's death through reckless behavior, while first-degree manslaughter is when you intentionally kill someone while in a state of "extreme emotional disturbance."

Once there, he was able to give some details to the local police that on the way home from a scout meeting, he had been approached by a young man asking for a ride.

It became tabloid fodder and even drew the attention of conservatives in the federal government who had been zeroing in on the LGBT community for decades. In the 1950s, during Joseph McCarthy's Red Scare, more gay men were fired from government jobs and suspected communists. The so-called lavender scare among lawmakers, lawyers and judges easily transformed into gay panic. What makes the John Parisi murder trial unique in the life of the queer panic defense is how his lawyers stuck to Dr. Edward Kemp's 1920 theory of homosexual panic as it applied to police's defense.

First, they wanted to demonstrate that he was suffering from a mental illness. In this case, paranoid schizophrenia, which helped trigger a gay panic episode. The second part of the defense strategy was to show Robert Jackson's prior homosexual activity.

When John Parisi pulled the trigger of the gun that killed Robert Jackson. He did so while repulsing a homosexual attack. A court appointed clinical psychologist who examined Parisi found him to be highly delusional, paranoid schizophrenic who is bisexual, loner with a basic distrust of people who had suppressed his emotions, causing periodical blowups. He found Parisi to be a highly latent homosexual who would avoid homosexual situations like the plague with strong feelings of inferiority, and testified that severe stress of any type could result in an acute schizophrenic reaction with accompanying amnesia.

When he was 19, his brother sat him down to talk to him about him being gay. He denied it even though they were fine with it. When his brother pressed that it was fine and that they'd stand up for him, he said, Well, maybe I'm bisexual. As he grew into his sexuality, he kept it hidden from his parents, who were both disabled and who he acted as caretaker for taking them to doctors appointments, buying the groceries, cooking the meals, cleaning their house, all while holding down a full time job.

When single he would go to gay or at least gay inclusive bars in more populated areas of the state.

Gaither was a regular there, another regular, Steve Mullins, also started hanging out at the tavern. His presence, though, wasn't quite so benign. He sometimes showed up wearing racist t shirts and harassing African-American customers. He was known locally as a wannabe skinhead. People mentioned later that they saw Mullins and Gaither together at the bar a lot. Assuming that Gaither was talking him out of his borderline white supremacist ways, sometimes they would leave together, which made some people assume that they had a sexual relationship when in reality, Billy Jack was well known for driving his drunk friends home at the end of the night.

Mullins had recently taken to hanging out with a man named Charles Butler. They'd known each other for years because Mullins had lived with Butler's cousin. The two were hanging out at the tavern one night when Billy Jack arrived a few hours later. No one was surprised when Billy Jack offered the pair drive home. What Billy Jack didn't know before he made the offer was that Mullins had told Butler that Billy Jack had propositioned him and that he was going to make sure it never happened again.

From all accounts, the proposition never actually happened. Billy Jack never had encounters with men from Sylacauga for fear that word would get back to his parents.

Though accounts for Mullins and Butler differ. We know that once they had arrived at the creek, the two began beating Billy, striking him over the head until he fell to the ground.

Clutching his throat, he begged for his life. The two men picked him up and dumped him in the trunk of his car.

Though I've only discussed the queer panic defense within America. It is by no means a uniquely American problem. Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and the UK also have their own versions of the defense with varying rates of success and legality.

Many judges today reject the defense immediately, and many juries will hold it against the defense for trying to use it. There's a stigma against the defense now, even if it is still perfectly legal in 39 states. But just because jurors and judges may dismiss the use of queer panic, it's not a sure thing. The only way to ensure that justice is achieved in the murder of queer people is to enact a legislative ban on the gay and trans panic defenses, something 11 states have done.

But what of the other 39? The Biden administration should put forward a bill flat out banning the use of the defense. Do away with it once and for all to show the homophobic and transphobic, hateful bigots that know it is not okay to kill people for being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or gender non-conforming. Our lives mean just as much as everyone else's.

You will not get away with killing us. You will not get a reduced sentence for killing us. Every year across America, people are killed for being who they are. They're killed because of the fragile masculinity of little men. Their lives ended in brutal, ugly nightmares because some their lives are worth nothing. That they won't be missed. That once they're dead and gone, their names will fade into obscurity.

Because for decades, centuries, that's what's happened. Our names were lost, our lives forgotten. But we will not forget. We cannot forget the names. Lives of the people lost to homophobia and transphobia. The sons and daughters whose parents will never see grow up. The people who have fallen to these crimes, the so-called panic. They were already taken away from US ones.

We have to make sure it doesn't happen again. So mourn their deaths and celebrate their lives, and most importantly, remember their names. Because now is the time to mourn those we've lost and fight like hell for those we've still got.

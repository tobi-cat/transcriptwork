<u>[James on a generic background in front of a book case.]</u>

Hey, everyone. We're going to do a simple video this time. No big fancy sets or multiple cameras. Because I just want to talk about the now *officially* Best Picture Oscar nominated movie *Everything Everywhere All At Once*. Maybe the best movie of 2022. So let's do a normal video essay for once and talk about something that's just *so*... so good.

## Part One: NOTHING

<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

<u>[James starts talking even as the part title is on-screen. Title fades after about six seconds.]</u>

There was never any indication that *Everything Everywhere All At Once* was going to feature a prominent queer character. In fact, from promotional material, nobody could really figure out what the movie was going to be about *at all*. <u>[Chuckling]</u> This movie dropped just as the Multiverse hype was hitting its cusp. 

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

<u>[Sudden cut to Nick in a behind-the-scenes setup, with green screen, a computer, a camera, boom mics with googly eyes around him.]</u>

Both Marvel and DC had been hyping their prospective upcoming Multiverse movies throughout 2020 and 2021. *Multiverse of Madness* and *Flashpoint* had been announced since... forever ago even by then, and the Loki series also poked at this idea. Other media, like content on the CW, had toyed with this for a while. There was enough multiverse buzz that critics leading up to *Everything Everywhere*'s release were hailing it as "the *best* multiverse movie".

<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

<u>[James in a coat on a colorful brick wall background. It is currently tinted pink, but over the course of the video, the tint start cycling through the rainbow.]</u>

Probably a good thing that it dropped sooner rather than later, because *Multiverse of Madness* had less to do with multiverses and more to do with demonizing women who have undergone debilitating trauma... made by *men* who openly admitted to having no familiarity with the preceding media and, while claiming to want to recreate the source material, *clearly* missed the point of said source material. And *Flashpoint* is... yeah. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

Without knowing too much about the plot, the movie was promoted on martial arts set pieces, whimsical vibes, and Michelle Yeoh, in general. But what we got was so much more. 

We're gonna get into spoilers here, but if you do press on without having seen the movie, it's *definitely* worth a watch afterwards because there's so much more that I just *cannot* get into here. 

</james>

<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

*Everything Everywhere All At Once* is about Evelyn Quan Wang, a Chinese immigrant who owns a laundromat in America, who *left* China with her soon-to-be-fiance because her parents didn't approve of the relationship. Evelyn is stressed, overwhelmed, and trying to take everything on her shoulders. On top of her father, Gong Gong, moving into their tiny apartment above the laundromat, Evelyn is struggling to connect with her daughter, Joy.

</nick>
<from></from>

<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

<u>[James in red-tinted darkness with a masquerade mask on. He also speaks with a deliberately over-dramatic tone.]</u>

Joy is an out lesbian who is *begging* her mother to acknowledge her girlfriend to Gong Gong, and in general. Evelyn deflects these requests, claiming that Gong Gong is very old-fashioned and that *she is just too busy* to deal with the fallout. Though it is implied that Evelyn isn't entirely comfortable with it *herself*, and brushes this off as a quirk, not seeing the *emotional toll* that it's taking on Joy.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

Evelyn frequently gets lost in thoughts and daydreams about what her life *could have been* if *only* she had made certain decisions differently. Namely, if she hadn't left China to be with her present husband, Waymond, who by the way has filed for divorce. She just doesn't know it yet.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

Like most people who would rather disassociate from the reality of their life, Evelyn likes to dip her toes into different hobbies, and she uses the laundromat to write off these expenses as side businesses. Which does not go over well with their caseworker from the IRS, Deidra, who gives them a few hours for a second chance to clear up the confusion on their tax returns, though Evelyn is *certain* it won't make any difference. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

She is, however, confronted by her husband, who takes on a *strange* personality shift. Waymond claims that he is now "Alpha Waymond", from the Alphaverse. In his home universe, Evelyn is a brilliant scientist who developed "verse-jumping", a technology that can allow a person to access alternate versions of themselves in different universes. Each time someone makes a decision, an alternate universe branches off to accommodate all outcomes of said decision. This verse-jumping allows someone to gain access to *skills and talents* that they had gained in *other* universes. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

He warns Evelyn that a powerful verse-jumper is after her, named Jobu Tapaki, after making her first verse-jump, Evelyn is murdered by Jobu, only to learn that it is her *daughter Joy*. In the Alphaverse. Evelyn has worked with Joy to test verse-jumping. She pushed Joy beyond the safety limits, and *split* Joy's consciousness apart. Joy now exists in all possible universes at once, flipping between different versions of herself and swapping between different elements of different universes. With this *power*, she seeks to conquer *all universes*, for reasons yet unknown.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

After being exposed to a large number of her own universal variants, Evelyn's father is revealed to be the leader of the resistance against Joy. As Evelyn fights against both Jobu Tupaki and also Gong Gong's forces, her mind splinters, exposing her to a wide range of alternate realities that she inhabits. Beginning to develop the same abilities as Jobu, she can draw from a *multitude* of different versions of herself, *even* in universes not accessible to verse-jumping technology.

She's a movie star in the "Kung Fu Evelyn Universe". She's a renowned singer in the "Stabs eyes out accidentally Universe" She's a spinning sign woman and one universe which... maybe *not* a step up, but she's got moves!

<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

By accident she stumbles upon the "Hot dog finger Universe", where *she's a lesbian*, of course! I mean, if you've got hot dog fingers, why not? And she's a Master Chef in the "Rakakuni universe". <u>[As in "Ratatouille" except raccoons instead of rats.]</u> And there are *also* variations of each of these.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

Through her confrontations with Jobu across the variations of the Multiverse, it becomes clear that Jobu doesn't want to *kill* her mother, while she seems ambivalent toward killing anyone else. Keep in mind, Jobu and/or Joy is a being who exists in *all versions* of herself simultaneously. She sees no point in batting an eye over anything she does, because everyone she kills in one universe is still alive in another. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

For all their differences, Joy can think of no other person who is as disappointed with their life as her mother. And while Joy was broken-hearted that her own mother wouldn't stand up for her. Jobu is only annoyed.

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.eeaot %}>

<u>[Jobu, in a golfer's outfit, gasps turns to the side. Things seem to pause.]</u>

</clip>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

She is annoyed that her mother has chosen to close off herself to a single way of thinking specifically. And indicates that her homophobia is a *symptom*, not the *root* of Evelyn's problems. 

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

When Jobu shows Evelyn her plans for the Multiverse, Evelyn tries to defend her actions, saying that she just doesn't want to upset her father this late in life. 

</nick>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.eeaot %}>

<u>[Everyone's in white garb and eye makeup, except Evelyn who'se in a brown hijab.]</u>

Evelyn: "He's a different generation."

Jobu: "Mom, you don't have to hide behind him anymore."

</clip>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

Jobu's *grand evil plan* is that she is constructing an "everything bagel" (with everything on it) and she means *everything!* Sesame seeds, poppy seeds, *areoplanes*, lava lamps, Art Deco, hope, supernovas, Saturday morning cartoons, *sadness*, and, upon gazing at her great work, Jobu realized that in the context of *everything*... *nothing* really mattered. It was all just there. But there was no meaning to anything. Adding more and more on to the bagel, she just realized that less and less really had any inherent value!

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

She reveals that she was never seeking out Evelyn to kill her. She was seeking out a version of Evelyn who could understand. Joy is an emotionally intelligent lady, and based on Stephanie Hsu's performance, it's clear to me that she can put her mother's actions and beliefs in the context of who her mother is: What Evelyn has dealt with in *her* life, and especially how Evelyn feels about it. 

But in another way that just makes Joy even more bitter. She sees how Evelyn is living her life, and how she is doing *nothing* to change it. If anything had any value, surely Evelyn would put in a little bit more effort to change, and so this is why Joy feels that maybe a version of her mother could be made to understand exactly what this everything bagel means!

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

Instead, overwhelmed, Evelyn demands to be returned to her normal life, where she's hosting a Chinese New Year's party at her laundromat. She wants nothing to do with this verse-jumping stuff anymore, even if she gets to be an actress or a Kung Fu Master, it's just a fantasy. But Joy is there to remind her that she can never un-experience the mundanity of knowing just how sad her life is.

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

And all those universes are actually *worse* than a fantasy. It's visceral proof that she made the wrong decisions in her life, and that there's nothing she can do to *change* her circumstances in the "Laundromat Universe". Her life is falling apart due to decisions she cannot unmake. Might as well let it happen get over it and just stop making decisions before she makes it even worse for herself. 

Problem is... Evelyn's mind is still fractured and she herself is, like Jobu, simultaneously existing in a myriad of realities. She cannot escape these confrontations of what her life is.

</nick>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

The pressure sends Evelyn on a nosedive, smashing a window in the laundromat, signing the divorce papers, getting smashed drunk, and getting disowned by her father! Alternate reality Evelyn's aren't doing much better either, and it isn't until she sees Waymond trying to pull her back from the brink that she comes around. All her variants begin to clean up their messes... but Evelyn's mind splinters even further, and she is exposed to the full potential of *everything* she could have been. Some worse, some better, some even *animated!* 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

<u>[This appearance of this universe has a posturized "animated" filter over it.]</u>

But in the context of everything, the multitude of infinite possibilities and identities, Evelyn realizes that not one single action she does in any one single Universe actually means anything. There is no ripple of consequentialism. There is no great peril to the world, if she undertakes one solitary decision, because there are an infinite range of versions of herself where the decision was never available in the first place.

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

Evelyn sees that nothing means anything. But instead of Jobu's conclusion, Evelyn understands that... this just means she has the freedom to *choose* how she acts. If nothing means
*anything* and that means nothing has any real cosmic consequences either! Our
ultimate choice is that we choose the consequences that matter to *us*. Just as
Laundromat!Evelyn chose to live with the consequences of leaving her family for
Waymond. She begins to see what she got out of that, which was missing from other
universes.

And Evelyn chooses Joy, both feeling and the person. Because *her* Joy
means more to her than anything she could have in all the other universes
combined.

## Part Two: Nowhere
{% assign timecode = "11:58" %}

<compare>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

Queerness, as it manifests in this movie, is not the driving force of the plot. Joy's queerness is a wedge between her and Evelyn, but the wedge was put there by her mother. The plot frames Evelyn as the flawed character, whose narrative direction is to overcome her flaws. And like I said, homophobia was symptomatic of her inability to grow and change, simply because she did not believe it was possible for her to change.

The onus of choice was not on Joy to be straight, but for Evelyn to choose to accept it or not. Evelyn herself is alluded to be bisexual, as she is married to her IRS caseworker in the "Hot dog fingers Universe". Though it is unclear if this also applies to Laundromat!Evelyn. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

Perhaps the message here is that we have the potential to be *all* things. The more we realize that, the more we move toward love and acceptance of others. That our belief that a choice is finite only ever locks us into certain ways of thinking. In a movie entirely about choice, queerness is not a part of the discussion. It's not a choice. Joy's queerness factors into this film only as far as [it] generates conflict between mother and daughter. Joy's sexuality really only factors into the plot as a straw that breaks the camel's back. Even though this is what we see, characters reference any number of events that strain the relationship between Evelyn and Joy in the past.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

Beyond the textual references to Joy's listless lack of direction, there is a reading of this story where the universe jumping doesn't happen. Instead it's *just a fantasy*, concocted by Evelyn, or a metaphor to describe events in Evelyn's life. Alpha!Waymond describes Alpha!Evelyn's treatment of Joy in the Alphaverse:

</james>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.eeaot %}>

Waymond: "You saw her potential. So he pushed her... beyond her limit." 

</clip>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

We can extrapolate that Evelyn in the "laundromat Universe" did the same to Joy, in her own way. As Joy's mind fractured and merged with every other version of herself, she could not find a *single world* where she was living up to her mother's expectations. It makes sense: like many parents who had once been considered "gifted children" themselves, they see in their children everything that they could *not* be. By proxy of their children, they want to see their *own* potential realized. 

In universes where she remained in China, for whatever reason, Evelyn has only seen in prestigious careers. As a singer, her father is close at hand, and this is the *only* Universe where we see him express fondness towards her. While the particulars may be different, character beats and personalities remain consistent across the universe.

</nick>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

Alternate realities do a great deal to foil a character against themselves. Bearing in mind, sequences cut between each other sync up with events. 

Figurative actions in one Universe <u>[Evelyn signing divorce papers]</u> are literal actions in another <u>[Evelyn drawing a shiv on her husband]</u>. 

Figurative actions in one Universe <u>[Evelyn drawing a shiv on her husband]</u> are literal actions in another <u>[Evelyn signing divorce papers]</u>.

Based on the dizzying editing flipping between universes, it's difficult to keep track of which universe is which, and which one is the one with the narrative through line we *ought* to be following. The narrative description of Multiverse fill in a whole lot of plot holes. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

The universe where Evelyn assaults Diadra may seem to be the "main Universe", however this is the same universe where Joy manifests her "suicide bagel". And the universe we may *assume* to be the real one (because it's more grounded and handles the emotional conflict between Joy and Evelyn) is actually a universe in which Joy sent Evelyn to prove a point. This seems to carry on the divergent reality from Evelyn *not* punching Deidra, the universe we *end with* is not the universe we began with. 

But is the universe we end with even a universe we had seen before? Based on how the film clips between universes the entire final sequence of the movie may be disconnected from the plot of the others. In fact, when it comes to *every single other Universe* (with the exception of maybe the "Hot dog finger lesbian Universe"), we do not entirely *know* how they resolve. Everything is... kind of left dangling.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

Narratively, we, the audience, are shown the emotional beats, how each alternate universe ties into character development in others that have more of a through line. Thematically, the audience is being informed that what happens is less important than how these characters, and by extension the audience, handle their interpersonal relations and self-worth. Who someone *is* matters *more* than what someone does. But what's most important is how someone feels.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

The end of the film may be an entirely different Universe altogether, one where Evelyn does have her shit together, and where she does have a loving relationship with Waymond; where Gong Gong is a more supportive father and less of a prick; and where she is a more supportive and accepting mother to her gay child.

</james>

</clip>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

However, what is not present in the film (though perhaps this is suggested) is the idea the choices *absolutely* can split universes apart. But they may also be able to converge realities too. That conflict within the self may lead to opposing decisions that *splinter* the cosmos. But also that, if one truly understands that choices ultimately do not matter, then no choice needs to be made and universes do not need to branch, finding peace with one's *current* existence.

Joyce<sup class="add">[sic: Joy]</sup> stands on a precipice, where she has learned that in the context of not only one Cosmos but many, objects and events in reality do not matter. That is if all things matter the same, there is no singular thing that stands out. But she has existed in a family environment where her feelings don't matter. So why would anything else? Keeping in mind that her catalog of what's on the everything bagel... does not include people. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

Evelyn's realization, as aforementioned, was indeed that nothing mattered, but she came to understand this as a *liberating* factor! Neither her taxes, her father's approval, the laundromat, *nor* the fact that her husband wants to divorce her, mattered. And with all of these external pressures *melted away* she saw the root of her misery: the amount of conflict she was pulling into her life because she was over-focused on things that didn't matter. 

The receipt with the black permanent markers circling the unspecified dollar amount. *Just* like Jobu Tupaki's Everything Bagel, it is a *storm of bustle*... but the center was empty. The value of the receipt was meaningless. Contrasted against Waymond's googly eyes, his playful whimsy, his empathy... these are things we often dismiss as meaningless. But at their core... aren't these the things that make life worth living? 

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

Apparently everything, full of *actual* nothing, and apparently nothing, full of actual everything. The difference is perspective. The inability to distinguish which fits into which category is indicative of a society that has gone spiritually bankrupt. And we have been for some time. All the things we are told are important by society's latent methods of conditioning us are the *completely* wrong things that we should be focusing on. instead, where value lies is the ability to see value in everyone and everything. And that if putting googly eyes on everything is necessary to help us pack-bond, then maybe that's necessary. Even if it's ridiculous. And also... perhaps we should place more value on ridiculousness.

</nick>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

Because the more seriously we take everything, the more the unserious things like... feelings begin to get left behind. if the stress and importance of life is placed on stuffy things like business, success, stability... what value do Evelyn's dreams and hobbies have? what do Joy's queer feelings even *matter*... when the Family Laundromat is being audited. 

</james>
<from></from>

## Part Three: Never

<compare>
<james class="eeaot-brickWall" {% include timecode %}>

We are reminded that choices diverge universes. But Joy seems to be a lesbian in every Universe, regardless of her or her mother's choices. This is inescapable. The only choice is how individuals react to it. And perhaps, as a society, we need to begin evaluating what really is or is not a choice. 

While some may retort that, in some universes, Evelyn is queer, we must also remind ourselves that she belongs to one of the many generations where it was the social expectation for bisexual people, especially women, to force themselves into heterosexual thinking. Over the years, many bisexual people have had to dismiss their same gender attractions because society never really *let* them explore it.

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

Again, the choice is in the reaction to this information. the decision, whether to or not accept this about oneself, can cause *drastic* shifts in how one lose their life. 

</nick>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

In our evolving world of queerness, one of the most significant discussions we are having is how to navigate bigotry at home. At times, queer commentators will sometimes make *sweeping generalizations* and statements about the improving condition of queer acceptance... within their own families. And I do this from time to time myself. However, even in America and what global society misguidedly refers to as "the West", there is still a widespread pressure for families to produce heterosexual children. And especially when it comes to trans teenagers and even early trans-identifying children, there seems to be a whole lot of questions about how to raise them. There's an overall confusion arising around the intersection between sexuality, gender, and sex. Even parents who are otherwise on-board with trans acceptance can be *squeamish* about the idea of *their* child transitioning. cynically, I may suggest that in the rush for widespread acceptance, we never really described what acceptance looked like.

</james>
<from></from>
<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

And now we &mdash; as teenagers, young adults, and... <u>[shudders]</u> adults &mdash; are struggling with how to redirect our language regarding how we are treated by those closest to us. Mere *"tolerance"*, it turns out, can be quite toxic. But among people for whom tolerance was a struggle, asking for something *more* can feel like asking *too much.* 

</james>
<from></from>
<nick class="eeaot-greenScreen" {% include timecode %}>

In the film's opening, as much as Evelyn is *tolerant* of Joyce sexuality, she certainly seems to resent that she *has* to be. The best she can offer is... passive ignorance. Why put in the effort when the choice to give one's attention to the black hole that is the family business is *right there.* 

This is the trauma of queer tolerance, where we see our family making an *effort*, but we also see what that effort amounts to. We see *all the other things* that are more important than trying to care. Some of us see the hierarchy of value and we see that our feelings and personal dignity are fairly low on the checklist. Some of us begin to see that our family only really cared about us as an idea. And that maintaining the idea of us is a whole lot more important than validating who we actually are.

Queer estrangement exists for this reason, and is quite common, probably taking over from queer disownment. The pendulum has swung the other way. And many of us simply can't reconcile our relations with family. It's nothing so trivial as parents just don't understand, it is rooted in parents *refusing* to change their understanding. And having lived with them for *our* entire lives, we see how much they are capable of and we see that their capability seems to end with changing their minds about *us*. When our personhood diverges from the expectation of what we *should* be, we really begin to see how much we mean to these people who have meant the world to us. and we watch as the language of "tolerance" leads them to believe that their efforts are enough, and we internalize our emptiness as... ingratitude. 

We can either exist in their lives feeling guilty for wishing for more, or we can put distance between us and our family. There's nothing you or anyone can do to change someone's mind once it's made up. After a while, it gets overwhelming. All you can do is control your own feelings and your own decisions, and sometimes it is easier to cut and run... Because others may not have the capacity to understand the difference between *their* choices and who *you* are.

And Evelyn *escaped* this, by realizing that *nothing mattered*. She got tired of pessimistic cynicism. *Time to get **wired** on liberating nihilism!* If gender doesn't matter, what do any of these reservations and feelings and Hang-Ups matter? If nothing matters, neither social expectations, family conditioning, polite appearances... Then who cares who does what? As long as nobody's hurting anybody, *including themselves*. Shouldn't avoiding that kind of *pain* be the objective?

And if that *is* the objective, as many say it is, why aren't we building a world that is focused on connection, emotions, fulfillment? Why are we still *obsessing* over expectations and vaguely defined parameters of success?

If nothing else matters, what *does* matter is how you feel about others and how you feel about yourself. In a world where everything is fluid and flexible and maybe does or does not actually exist, your feelings *are* the only things that you can guarantee to be true! truly true! and if the structure of the world is composed of our memories, then the goodness or evil of the world is predicated on your past choices. And whether or not they are choices that you are proud of, or that you regret. and the thing about pride is that there is no real qualification for that. you can choose to qualify your self-worth based on external factors (comparing yourself to others or expectations imposed on you), &mdash;

<james class="eeaot-masquerade" {% include timecode %}>

&mdash; But for *all that* nothing else matters. You and your feelings are the only things you can be certain of. you can choose your own expectations. *And* you can choose to meet them or not. You can choose to see the hole in the center of the bagel as emptiness... or you can choose to see it as freedom. You can look at the googly eyes as a ridiculous waste of time, *or* you can choose to understand that *someone* is trying to lift the burden of the world off your shoulders.

<james class="eeaot-bookShelf" {% include timecode %}>

But you cannot choose not to exist. And you cannot choose for others to exist in a different way. For all that we choose we owe it to everyone else to let them choose for themselves. So, be who you are. Be who you want to be. If you feel like you're too old for that now, or you've made too many choices pulling you away from what you really want, you're wrong. It's never too early or too late to be the best version of yourself. 

Because the best version of yourself isn't living in an alternate universe. They're already a part of you. Waiting for you to choose Joy.

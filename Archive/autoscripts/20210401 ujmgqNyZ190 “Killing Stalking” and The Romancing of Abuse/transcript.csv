"James Somerton","00:00:01:01","00:00:23:05","I just wanted to drop a content warning here as both physical and psychological abuse are discussed in this video. I also wanted to thank Chaos, Opus Studio, who composed the score in this video. They're also an animal welfare charity that raises money through the creation of Lgbtqia+ media, including an upcoming animated adaptation of Killing Stalking. You can check them out at the link in the description."
"James Somerton","00:00:24:05","00:00:47:14","And you know, like sharing, subscribe and sign up for my Patreon for monthly exclusives like Early Access audio commentaries behind the scenes Featurettes and movie Watch Along Parties. All right. Now on with the show. So if you're anything like I was circa six weeks ago, you're probably thinking, what the hell is killing stalking? I too was once so naive."
"James Somerton","00:00:48:04","00:01:09:11","You see, the day I released the power couple video, I got an emergency call to come home because my mom was in the hospital. Home for me is a five hour drive away. So instead of premiering the video as planned, I just set it to live. Jumped in my car and drove. My mom pulled through, thank God. But it was pretty touch and go for a while."
"James Somerton","00:01:09:17","00:01:30:04","So as I waited in the hospital and in my hotel room, I started checking the comments and the power. Couple of video, lots of love, which I definitely needed right then. But there were also a few people absolutely haranguing me because they thought the couple in the video's thumbnail wasn't wicked and hoping from Marvel Comics the subject of the video."
"James Somerton","00:01:31:02","00:01:59:05","But young mom and son. Whoa. And they were absolutely furious that I would have the gall to portray them in any kind of positive light. And all I could think was, Who the hell are you, Mom and song? Wow. If I wasn't already in such an emotional state, I would have ignored the comments as simply being misinformed. But they were calling me out on a bad day, so I decided I'd better do some research."
"James Somerton","00:01:59:22","00:02:25:07","So I use the hotels. Honestly? Shockingly good wi fi to hop on to the good old google.com and look up song. Well, and you and Mom. This is when I came across the Korean webcomic Killing, stalking. And right below that in the Google search in the people also ask section was the question does song someone love you and bum oh they're gay."
"James Somerton","00:02:26:11","00:02:57:16","Let's investigate it now because I'm a good law abiding citizen who would never, ever, ever pirate. I hunted around online for the books of killing, stalking, which I was seeing described as a psychological romance, romantic thriller, and dark romance. But try as I might, no online bookstore would sell me an English version of the comic. French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish and Korean versions were plentiful and even available with prime shipping, but nothing in English."
"James Somerton","00:02:58:18","00:03:28:19","Fine, I'll do the bad thing and read it online. Well, shit. So because I had nothing better to do than sit in a hospital rooms and hotel rooms. I read the whole thing in two or three days. All 67 issues, multiple special issues, holiday issues and author notes. And it was good. A dark psychological thriller about loneliness, trauma and severe abuse."
"James Somerton","00:03:29:04","00:04:03:11","Closer to a horror novel than a thriller. Right in my wheelhouse. But then I thought back to how I'd seen it described online. Dark? Yes. Psychological. Yes. Thriller. Yes. Or romance. It had always been described as a romance. Who the hell was describing this as a romance? According to the Internet, a lot of people. Which suddenly I understood why some commenters were so angry that they thought I'd used an image of this couple and put a power couple beside it."
"James Somerton","00:04:03:13","00:04:31:04","And because I'm never one to turn down making a mistake, I decided to dive deep into the killing stalking fandom, which has a surprisingly large presence on TikTok. Personally, I'd loved the series. It was something akin to Gillian Flynn novels, stories about extremely flawed, emotionally broken people. But what I saw online was a community obsessed with the romance between the two lead characters the emotionally stunted Unabomber and the serial killer he's infatuated with."
"James Somerton","00:04:31:10","00:04:43:03","Sung Whoa. Now, before we talk about why looking at our relationship is anything even close to a romance is wrong. Let's go over the plot of the series so that you know what I'm talking about."
"James Somerton","00:05:24:06","00:05:50:19","Young mom is a depressed twentysomething who's had a pretty hard life, having lost his parents at a young age. He's been brought up by his grandmother and abusive uncle. He was drafted into the Korean military. Military service is compulsory in South Korea, and despite his frail body and psychological instability, he's still forced to serve. While in training camp, he becomes the target of other recruits who accuse him of being gay and make fun of him for looking like a girl."
"James Somerton","00:05:51:00","00:06:15:10","In one such altercation, his attackers are just about to rape him when he's rescued by another recruit, a handsome young man a few years his junior Sango. Ever since then, young mom has become infatuated with Sonko. After both completed their term of duty, he began following him around, finding out where he lived and even figuring out the security code to his house based on which buttons look to be pushed the most."
"James Somerton","00:06:15:20","00:06:44:02","Eun Bum essentially becomes the stalking in killing. Stalking. One day he manages to actually get in to the house, though he's almost thwarted by a police drive by. Once inside the house, he's almost euphoric to be in Sonko's private space. He has a look around but starts to hear noises from the basement. He goes down, partially hoping to find Sonko, but is shocked to find a mutilated young woman tied up and screaming for help."
"James Somerton","00:06:44:10","00:07:02:12","But when he takes off her blindfold, she screams for him to stay away. Hasn't noticed that Sonko has snuck up behind him, having been told that someone was in his house by the police outside. One of those officers, by the way, believes that Sonko killed his own parents. But we'll get to that later. So Sonko smashes Bam over the head with a bat."
"James Somerton","00:07:03:18","00:07:28:21","He tries to escape, but can't get past the much larger sonko. And so in an act of panic, he professes his love for him, telling him that he's been in love with him for years, ever since the military. Sonko seems to calm down with this and even invites him upstairs. When young mom asks if he's been forgiven for breaking into his house, Sonko says yes, but not with his legs in that state."
"James Somerton","00:07:30:01","00:07:53:08","Eventually destroying bombs, ankles with a sledgehammer. And here in this dark basement guest starring a soon to be corpse is where the love story of Sonko and Yoon Bond begins. It's not problematic at all. But when Bum wakes up now chain next to the girl who is now dead. By the way, Sonko confesses that although he kills women on the regular, he hasn't killed a man since his father."
"James Somerton","00:07:53:16","00:08:24:22","He starts force feeding Yun Bum some sort of porridge gruel before leaning in and kissing him and bomb instead of fearing for his life, which would be understandable in the situation. Wonders to himself. Does this mean we're dating? So after an unspecified amount of time chained up in the basement, assuming weeks, Sonko decides it's time to bathe, bomb, bath, bomb to wash him once he's all clean and now dressed in girl's clothing."
"James Somerton","00:08:25:06","00:08:47:03","Sonko tells him that he's going to let him live under two conditions. He never passes the threshold of the stairs at the house entrance, and he has to do all the cooking, cleaning and other housework. Essentially, bomb underpaying of death is made into song was mother, but bomb needs to eat off of a plate on the floor, presumably because Sonko doesn't want to humanize him too much."
"James Somerton","00:08:47:19","00:09:15:16","And Sonko watches him like a hawk, even when he's on the floor eating, just waiting for him to make a mistake, any mistake so that he can physically assault him. And he does on multiple occasions. No offense is too slight to bring on the wrath of Sonko. Eventually, someone with signs from the task of organizing a collection of shelves in the storage room while doing so, Bomb finds a bottle of rat poison and gets the idea to put it into song woes."
"James Somerton","00:09:15:16","00:09:37:06","Food. He'll be fine because Song won't ever let him eat at the table, let alone the same food as him. But not that night. Now Sonko invites him up to the big boy table and bomb is forced to eat first, which makes him violently ill. Later that night, when Bomb is done throwing his guts up, song well, actually lays him down on his own bed."
"James Somerton","00:09:38:00","00:10:03:10","And here we discover that song was father was incredibly abusive, particularly to his mother, and would force the two of them to eat off of the floor just like he was making bomb do. But just in case you thought the author was humanizing Sonko in some way, he then follows up his confession by telling Bomb that he hates people like him, people who are always complaining about their lot in life, that he has no sympathy for broken people, that they're useless."
"James Somerton","00:10:03:10","00:10:29:14","But for one thing. And then we find out what that one thing is with an insanely awkward sex scene that is, despite what many fans think rape, the power dynamic between the two is too vast. Sonko has far too much control over bomb for it to not be rape. Sorry shippers. This isn't a loving sex scene. It is sexual assault where the aggressor is a serial killer and the victim is psychologically underdeveloped."
"James Somerton","00:10:29:20","00:11:03:04","This is not romantic anyway. Bum continues to do everything he's told, creating a bond of trust with Sonko leading to song one day, saying that he needs to go out for a little while. Bomb immediately decides this is the time for him to make his escape. He changes his clothes. He passes the threshold and approaches the door. But then he stops and starts thinking, Yes, life with Sonko is pretty terrible, but he hasn't been so bad since they had sex."
"James Somerton","00:11:04:00","00:11:23:03","Not nice by any means, but not terrible. But if bum escapes and goes home, he'll be left at the mercy of his abusive uncle, who we've now discovered has been raping bombs since he was a child. But at least then you have a modicum of freedom. And so he opens the door smelling fresh air for the first time in months."
"James Somerton","00:11:24:05","00:11:49:13","But sitting on the stoop waiting for him is Song SONKO. This was a test to see a test. The bomb has failed. And so someone assaults him, leaving him a bloody mess in the street, all the while laughing and yelling, Somebody save him. But nobody comes. This area is mostly deserted. It's a bad area of town. Bomb can yell and yell, but no one will save him."
"James Somerton","00:11:50:22","00:12:08:10","Sonko takes him back into the house, throws him back into the basement and tortures him in a scene that would feel at home in SA. Now, as I mentioned earlier, one of the police officers we met in the first issue has been looking into song. Well, because he's thoroughly convinced that he killed his parents. The details around their deaths are just too sketchy."
"James Somerton","00:12:08:14","00:12:31:04","This has been running throughout the series, by the way. He eventually decides it's time to investigate Sonko's house and does a walk through. He looks everywhere but doesn't find any evidence of foul play. He also doesn't find bomb, which Sonko notices. Once the officer leaves, still very suspicious, Sonko flies into a fit of rage, convinced that Bomb used this opportunity to flee."
"James Somerton","00:12:31:19","00:12:52:00","He searches the house, the basement outside, and he can't find him anywhere. But once back in the house, he finds a bomb on the floor. He's been hiding from the cop. He grabs him. You're in tears saying they're going to be together forever. In fact, Sonko decides it's time to win Bomb over. So he gives him some crutches."
"James Somerton","00:12:52:00","00:13:20:02","Since bomb's ankles are still wrecked and takes him shopping for new clothes. At one point, bomb is actually alone in the store. This is a public mall. He's got the chance to escape. He can approach a security guard. He can call 911. This is his chance. But instead he starts to panic and looks for Sonko instead. Stop. Okay, that's enough Synopsis Sizing."
"James Somerton","00:13:20:02","00:13:50:13","For now. We need to talk about Stockholm syndrome. This term is thrown around a lot and most cops and even psychologists question its validity whether or not it even exists. But in my opinion, killing stalking is a textbook case of Stockholm syndrome. In theory, at least, the term originates from a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973. Young Erik Olsen took four employees hostage during the robbery and held them captive for six days in one of the bank's vaults."
"James Somerton","00:13:51:00","00:14:23:18","When finally released, none of the captives would testify against Olsen. Instead, they began raising money for his defense fund. Their sudden connection with the captor became popularly known as Stockholm Syndrome, the symptoms of which are. Perceiving kindness or compassion from the captor or abuser, developing positive feelings toward the individual or group holding you captive or abusing you. Adopting the same goals, worldview and ideology as your captor or abusers feeling pity toward those abusing you."
"James Somerton","00:14:23:21","00:14:47:19","Refusing to leave them even when given the opportunity to escape. Having negative perceptions towards police, family, friends, and anyone else who may try to help you escape the situation. And refusing to assist police and government authorities in prosecuting the perpetrators of abuse or kidnaping. People like to throw around this diagnosis for a lot of things like Disney's beauty and the Beast, where 100% is not applicable."
"James Somerton","00:14:47:23","00:15:09:16","But here it 100% is in bomb hits. Every single one of the diagnostic triggers for Stockholm syndrome. He feels song always being compassionate toward him when he so much as lets him eat. He not only develops positive feelings for Song Low but full on falls in love with them. At least he believes he does. He helps song well to commit murders and even dispose of bodies."
"James Somerton","00:15:10:11","00:15:33:07","He feels pity for song. Well, after finding out about his abusive childhood. He eventually won't run away, given the chance. Sure, his first attempt failed, but what about in the mall and multiple other instances during the series? He's suspicious of the police officer trying to help him. And finally, he refuses to assist the police when given the opportunity to do so."
"James Somerton","00:15:33:20","00:16:00:14","Eventually, the story moves on to the point where the police officer has gotten enough evidence, he believes, to arrest and convict Songo for murder and kidnaping. He brings both song well and uniform to the police station, but uniform won't say a bad word about song while he's the only witness they've got and he won't say a thing, especially after song declares to the police station that he and bum are a couple that he loves him."
"James Somerton","00:16:01:22","00:16:25:17","This declaration sends Bom into a euphoric tailspin, resulting in him agreeing with everything Song Lo says, refusing to cooperate with the police and eventually the police dropping all possible charges. Even after Song Lo tells him that he was just lying to get the cops off of his back. Uniform holds on to the original Declaration of Love. That's what he wants to remember."
"James Somerton","00:16:25:17","00:16:51:23","And so that's what he will remember. As the series progresses, we get deeper and deeper into the supremely toxic relationship between these two men. It becomes clear if it wasn't already that both are mentally ill. Unum has severe depression, anxiety and abandonment issues. While Sung is a narcissistic psychopath, he has a very high opinion of himself, and anyone who isn't him is basically scum."
"James Somerton","00:16:52:09","00:17:15:10","Tools to be used by him until they're no longer useful to him. And that's what Jung bomb becomes to him. A tool especially for sex. These sex scenes are violent, disturbing and painful to read. It's honestly very hard to believe that certain fans think that they were written to be romantic. Young Bomb begins to represent some girl's mother in more ways than one as well."
"James Somerton","00:17:15:11","00:17:35:10","Not only does he care for Sonko in a motherly way, but in a series of flashbacks, We also learn that song Girl's Mother sexually Molested him as a child, and so his now regular Sex with Young Bomb is a continuation of the relationship with his mother. This drawn connection between Jung Bom and song was Mother eventually becomes a source of anxiety for him, though."
"James Somerton","00:17:36:00","00:17:55:10","You see, Song was Mother was actually the one who killed his father. He didn't do it. His mother did. But in a blatant act of gaslighting, she convinced her son that he killed him in a fit of paranoia. His mother decided that song Wo needed to die as well. And so she tried killing him with the very rat poison that Yoon Bom attempted to kill him with early on in the series."
"James Somerton","00:17:55:17","00:18:17:00","Song Wo eventually discovered this and killed her, arguably in self-defense. And so the people he trusted most in his life, his mother and his father, both betrayed him in one way or another. And now, near the end of the series, he fears that Yoon Bom will do the same thing after an injury leaves him unable to leave the house."
"James Somerton","00:18:17:06","00:18:44:05","He's forced to rely on Yoon Bom to do the grocery shopping and run errands. Convinced that Yoon Bom is either going to run away or kill him. Bom never does, though, but the paranoia remains. During this time, the police officer who had been trying to bring some low down has been having more or less a mental breakdown. But a confluence of events gets him back into the case leading into a violent confrontation between himself and song."
"James Somerton","00:18:44:12","00:19:13:07","When Song Lo is restrained, he calls for Yoon Bom to get the knife that he dropped and kill the cop to save him. Bom gets the knife but can't do it. He lets it clatter to the floor. Song lowers shocked, looks at Bom and says simply, I don't need you anymore. The cop orders bom to run away. Once out in the pouring rain, he stands outside looking at the house that's been his home and prison For God only knows how long."
"James Somerton","00:19:14:03","00:19:35:19","Inside the battle continues and thanks to a gas stove and a lighter, an explosion rips through the building. Jung Bom is taken to the hospital where he recovers from his multiple wounds. When he gets out, he goes in search of someone who last you'd heard was alive in another hospital. Here we learn that song was dead. Not from his injuries, but by being smothered by another patient."
"James Somerton","00:19:37:01","00:20:11:22","She couldn't handle his mumbling through the bandages day and night all the time, calling out bombs name. The series ends with Yoon Bom, seeing who he thinks is song while even though he's dead and running into traffic to chase after him. When it comes to doing an analysis of killing stalking, we're going to run into some problems. What's the subtext that the author is trying to get across?"
"James Somerton","00:20:12:04","00:20:33:19","What are we intended to come away with? Doesn't even matter. Do the author's intentions matter? How much context is needed for killing, stalking, and what is meant to be just taken at face value? I for one, find it very unsettling that it's perceived as romantic, not only by the shippers, by the way, but also by a great many people who read the comic and do understand that it's toxic."
"James Somerton","00:20:34:03","00:20:54:18","Alright, so if it's not a romance, what is it? It's a horror thriller. Obviously, this isn't even a psychological thriller. This is full on horror song. Wo is closer to Jigsaw than Hannibal Lecter. There are a few other themes that the work might be trying to talk about as well. Treatment or dismissal of the mentally ill, the dangers of a culture which thrives on obsession."
"James Somerton","00:20:54:18","00:21:13:10","This is coming from the land of K-Pop, after all, and the negative effects of compulsory military service. Though I can't speak to the reality in South Korea, in North America, mental illness is absolutely treated as something for which you might see a psychologist a handful of times where you'll eventually be put on meds and never checked in on again."
"James Somerton","00:21:13:13","00:21:32:15","And that's if your insurance even covers it. I have a pretty good job and it still only covers two psych visits a year. The mental wellness institution as a whole generally doesn't much care about you. Yoon Bom gets the overarching diagnosis of borderline personality disorder because he obsesses over people and then he's just tossed out into the street."
"James Somerton","00:21:33:19","00:22:09:11","It really resonates with how I see the system failing people with mental illness in the real world every single day. Not to mention that in spite of his history of mental illness, he is drafted for service in the Korean military because instead of treating people and offering them the strategies and coping mechanisms they need, we're going to isolate them in an environment that is built to withhold special treatment in order to foster an environment of conformity, at which point killing, stalking asks a very strange question of the reader to discern where individual decisions begin and where societal familial conditioning ends."
"James Somerton","00:22:10:04","00:22:38:05","At what point is a toxic individual a failure of a society at large, and at what point should we start judging them for their own actions? Any time we analyze a story that is at all left open for interpretation, there are going to be people who disagree with your take on it and just yell. You just don't get it now."
"James Somerton","00:22:38:16","00:23:02:17","I don't think there actually are multiple ways of looking at killing, stalking. It's a horror story, not romance. But a lot of people are coming away, seeing it as a romance. So is their interpretation wrong? Yes. But let's pretend it's not. Let's pretend that this story's themes are vague and look at it alongside some other works of art that people disagree on."
"James Somerton","00:23:02:20","00:23:24:03","Art is in the eye of the beholder, After all. Is killing, stalking a surface? Beauty and the beast style romance where the monster can change in the end. Or is it, as I believe, an analysis of trauma and abuse? Granted, there have been any number of times when an audience, especially an academic one, falls into the trap of just assuming that everything is deeper than it really is."
"James Somerton","00:23:24:17","00:23:49:05","In fact, in some cases people read into a work of fiction to find layers when there are none intended just to justify their appreciation of it. But even when things aren't done to deliberately troll intellectuals, there's a trend of intellectuals taking a body of work and saying, Well, if this play is deep, then all must be deep, like half of Shakespeare, if not more."
"James Somerton","00:23:49:09","00:24:05:12","Is that a hot take now? Not really. Like, come on. The man wrote almost 40 plays in 20 years. You can't expect every one of them to have a nuanced, insightful World Vision. He had to put food on the table for him and his troupe of actors and his boyfriend. He was a business man before he was a creator."
"James Somerton","00:24:05:23","00:24:29:06","Most of what he wrote was on commission. That doesn't mean that Hamlet or Macbeth aren't excellent expressions of literary subtlety, but there isn't much that's subtle about Titus Andronicus, where the hero takes the two sons of the villain, bakes them into a pie and feeds them to her. It's basically Shakespeare's slasher movie, which that's why it's my favorite Shakespeare to play."
"James Somerton","00:24:29:11","00:25:04:07","And the biggest fallacy of his career was that Romeo and Juliet, arguably his most iconic work, wasn't meant to be a classic, like big shock time. All those guys in high school English who gagged at the gratuitous romance in the play, who were dismissed by the English teacher, were actually right. See, aside from the fact that this is a grotesque amount of romance that chokes out what little plot actually exists in Romeo and Juliet, there are a number of dated cultural contexts that highlight that this is a relationship Shakespeare would have considered toxic."
"James Somerton","00:25:04:07","00:25:27:11","Taking this into consideration, it becomes a cautionary tale. Juliet, referring to her love as being in excess, was a key feature. Elizabethan England was stuck in a bit of an austerity kick where modernity and temperance were strongly valued. Anything in excess was seen as dysfunctional. So the fact that they both die at the end really should have been a tip off."
"James Somerton","00:25:28:10","00:25:58:11","Shakespeare was probably thinking the fact that their affair leads to both of their deaths should tell audiences that this is a bad nobody's going to find death romantic. Romeo and Juliet, therefore, should not be viewed as a romance, but a satire, a parody of romance and romantic plays. I'm sure most people are more accustomed to hearing about satire and parody when it's comedic, which it is much easier to make a clear thematic satire when it comes to comedy."
"James Somerton","00:25:59:02","00:26:29:15","But satire is just a matter of pushing a medium into the territory of the carnivalesque. Actions, decisions, reactions and elements of design and theme are so absurd that they reach a point where it's impossible to take them seriously. At least that's the idea. Satire is usually comedy because if you're trying to defame the Nazis, it's easy to do so by making them look like fools because you're simply taking elements of how they already were foolish in history and amplifying it."
"James Somerton","00:26:30:01","00:26:46:12","Sometimes you can get away with being honest in comedic satire because the events that you were making fun of really were that ridiculous. And sometimes you have to tone it back or people will think it's too over-the-top. Stalin is invincible, but falls to shit Death. Back to the Silk Road. What's happening?"
"Speaker 2","00:26:47:11","00:26:55:11","This is impossible. And I'm wonderful tweeting. What is the truth? Well, maybe some point in his successor."
"James Somerton","00:26:55:22","00:27:22:17","A drawback to this is that it's not always entirely clear what is being made fun of. This is especially true in absurdist or ironic depictions. Is South Park making fun of Al Gore claiming that climate change is an imaginary issue, or are they doing the opposite and making fun of the people who dismiss Al Gore saying that what they imagine Al Gore acts like isn't the reality of how he portrays himself?"
"James Somerton","00:27:22:23","00:27:58:19","And for reference, South Park's defenders often do use that. You just don't get it defense when it comes to criticisms directed at them. And they do tend to cross the line every once in a while. But this video is not about South Park. Satire can also be dramatic, though this is less common in modern media, however. Here we take culture and history and rather than amplify the ridiculousness, take elements of violence, bigotry, romance, political ideology, or even culture itself and bring the real life absurdity to the audience's attention."
"James Somerton","00:27:58:22","00:28:38:09","The hope is for these themes to be read as societal problems. The downside to this is that the line between satire and irreverence is very narrow. Was Stanley Kubrick presenting a horrifying depiction of psychological conditioning, trauma and groupthink as it exists in the American military in full metal Jacket? I mean, that's probably how he intended it. But if you're an individual who values elements of hypermasculinity, pro violence and American imperial ism, then you can just as easily see Full Metal Jacket as a shining testament to an era when men were men and weak, undeserving men simply snapped under the pressure in which real men persisted."
"James Somerton","00:28:38:14","00:29:16:08","As for what Kubrick intended. It's a little bit difficult to gauge. He offered phenomenally little information about what his films were intended to really be about. He liked to see them as a litmus test, which had more to say about the Observer, depending upon how they would interpret the film. This is epitomized in his final film, Eyes Wide Shut, which is about something even when some of us think there's no way someone could have positive interpretations of a work, There is someone who is going to read A Clockwork Orange and think, Yeah, that's what masculinity means."
"James Somerton","00:29:16:17","00:29:48:21","And the government is the villain because they brainwashed him out of his individuality. But in instances like Kubrick's nuanced vagueness, can we really use intention as a means to analyze works of fiction? All this is to say that I'm taking an analysis of killing, stalking very seriously. And even though my focus is, as you might have been able to tell the audience's attitudes about it, it's important to know that people can see art in very different ways."
"James Somerton","00:29:57:02","00:30:21:12","One of the most significant philosophies of art criticism comes from Gene Bullard. He argues in very generalized terms that we as a society have lost or are losing our ability to tell the difference between artifice and nature, meaning we can't really see a clear difference between a performance and an earnest state of being what is real and what is counterfeit, and to what degree can we tell the difference between the two?"
"James Somerton","00:30:21:13","00:30:52:08","This is more in the vein of, say, being unsure if the Kardashians are errant airheads or whether this role is emphasized in their programing. In order to fulfill a brand which they use to solidify and expand their platform. A bestie. This is especially true in instances of long spanning performance art, as you could see among Lady Gaga, Cher, Madonna, or even people like Ann Colter, Donald Trump, where the performance ends and the individual begins and how much they overlap are both areas of debate."
"James Somerton","00:30:52:18","00:31:18:11","An extrapolation of this in the situation of killing stalking is whether this is intended to be a work of fiction, which plays upon and subverts romantic tropes, or whether it's earnestly romantic. When I read it, I read a very conflicted horror story where neither of the main characters were particularly meant to be admirable and where the element of romance was there to highlight the insidious ness of Sangamo and the dysfunction of uniform."
"James Somerton","00:31:18:16","00:31:39:19","As this is a visual novel, meaning that the visual language is just as important as the written text. There are a number of instances as in the comic itself, specific panels which can be removed and shown as romantic Instances of cuddling, hugging and kissing are all present. Granted, this is usually before or after someone is tortured or killed or buried."
"James Somerton","00:31:41:03","00:32:12:15","Very romantic. But does this ability to separate these romantic elements form a kind of phantom plot in which the perceived romance runs parallel to the actual depiction of the toxic relationship. This could encourage someone to, against all reason, deliberately read romance into situations where there is none. This is to say nothing of the special issues for Christmas and Thanksgiving, where a sanguine young bomb are depicted romantically or erotically and without any torture except for the people that they are murdering and disposing of."
"James Somerton","00:32:12:15","00:32:44:04","But they're doing it together. On one hand, is this a matter of depicting a relationship at peak toxicity, or is this exploiting a will they won't they romantic format to keep audiences tuned in for 67 issues? Because in spite of these seemingly apparent layers and the seemingly self-aware damnation of its own content killing, stalking has acquired a certain following in spite of the obvious, or what seems to me to be obvious messaging about how damaging and traumatic this relationship is."
"James Somerton","00:32:44:11","00:33:06:04","If you can even call it a relationship, which I don't, there is a swath of fans who lean toward the will. They won't. They take that. This whole journey is a progressing romance, leading to someone finally giving into his feelings, stopping hurting young bomb and then running off together with him. The torture has been fantasize as a kind of love you to death kind of thing."
"James Somerton","00:33:06:20","00:33:35:18","Like song is so in love with you and bomb. But the only way he knows how to express affection is through abuse. All someone needs to do is learn how to properly express his feelings of affection, and then everything will just turn out fine. Being honest. The implication throughout the series is that someone keeps you alive because he reminds him of a maternal figure which you'd think would lead an audience to immediately connect him with Norman Bates."
"James Somerton","00:33:36:02","00:34:08:03","Well, a boy's best friend is his mother, but they don't. But maybe these people have watched as many movies as I have or even the TV show Bates Motel. So which is it, Gore porn or a star crossed romance or a character study of Stockholm's syndrome? We could look to the author who in front of every issue plasters a big old disclaimer that very explicitly says that this is a depiction of abuse and dysfunction, which, you know, that must clear it up."
"James Somerton","00:34:08:03","00:34:37:04","Right. Done deal. Maybe because we're also in an era of Joanne Karen Rowling prefacing everything with I love the transsexuals part. This tactic is called dog whistling, which is doing or saying something hateful, but in a vague enough way that you can credibly say, That's not what I was actually saying. People who are racist and homophobic and transphobic will be emboldened by the message and people who are indifferent or centrist will take it for granted as a joke."
"James Somerton","00:34:37:05","00:35:00:16","And even they themselves dismiss the haters as social justice snowflakes. In periods past, it was considered a point of pride to clearly advocate for your beliefs. But these were also eras which had a very clear hierarchy of privilege, and there was no shame in supporting the hierarchy today, where the majority of progress is dedicated to dismantling the systems of privilege and oppression."
"James Somerton","00:35:01:16","00:35:32:18","There is an awareness of the right thing to say, even if you don't necessarily believe it. Indicative of the I'm not racist, but line that always is followed by something racist. People want to be seen as progressive or at least on the right side, while still holding onto privileged attitudes and cultural stereotypes. Even bigoted people know how to properly carry themselves in order to advance their platform and not do or say anything to extreme in public."
"James Somerton","00:35:33:12","00:36:05:18","There's a reason the KKK wears hoods, much in the same way that someone knows how to act like a normal person in society so that he can blend in despite being a crazed psychopath. I wasn't just comparing J.K. Rowling to a psychopath. What are you talking about? So the series is written by a Korean author and illustrator who goes by the name of Kooky, for whom there is next to no information available online."
"James Somerton","00:36:06:04","00:36:29:19","I did manage to track down and translate an interview from 2018 where she was asked if there was any sincere feeling of love between the two lead characters. She responded, It's up to the readers to decide. If I have to decide, then no. Okay. But it's a bit odd that on every site where this is available for purchase or even for just reading, it's listed as a romance on Amazon."
"James Somerton","00:36:29:19","00:36:51:14","It's even classified as LGBT plus marriage comedy. She's also said that the book should be categorized as a psychological horror story and not a romance of any kind. So to be fair, if you visit her Twitter, the page is mostly populated with romantic fan art of Jung Bom and Song World. So where she really stands on how the series should be read might be up for interpretation."
"James Somerton","00:36:51:23","00:37:12:03","But let's take her at her word. In the 2018 interview that she does not intend on this being read as a romance in any way. Then why does the fan base read it like one and why? When I did my initial Google search, was it so often described as a psychological romance, romantic thriller, dark romance? Well, there's two answers to that question."
"James Somerton","00:37:12:15","00:37:35:13","One, the fans are doing the categorizing. Two, publishing. Yes, the archaic, slowly dying traditional publishing industry, which has real difficulty when it comes to queer themes and books, especially involving men. You see, when a book is being published, the publisher has to decide what kind of categories the book falls into so that it can be marketed to the proper audience."
"James Somerton","00:37:35:18","00:37:52:03","And when a book comes around with a gay lead character who doesn't have a romance in the plot, they have no idea how to classify it. Women don't want. To read a book about a gay straight men certainly don't want to read a book about a gay gaze, barely want to read a book about a gay, but a gay romance."
"James Somerton","00:37:52:04","00:38:11:15","Well, according to market research, women eat that up so much so that it makes up for the loss of a potential straight male audience. Gay readers don't really factor into the thought process, which is a problem in itself, and it's something I'll cover in another video. And so we come to killing. Stalking. Is this a romance? No. Even the author says so."
"James Somerton","00:38:12:00","00:38:36:01","But are there romantic elements? Not really. But could there maybe be perceived romantic elements if you tilt that the right way and read it under a quarter moon during February of a leap year? Maybe so. Into the M slash M romance category, you go. They don't just have to pick one category, though, which is why the much more applicable psychological thriller and horror tags also get put on there."
"James Somerton","00:38:36:16","00:38:59:12","So when readers are self categorizing the book online, it becomes a psychological romance, romantic thriller, dark romance. So from the synopsis of killing stalking, I think it's pretty clear that both characters Jung Bomb and Sango are not mentally stable. But in two very different directions. Both of their lives have become disasters since they were children with abusive caregivers in both cases."
"James Somerton","00:38:59:18","00:39:23:14","That's why there is no romance in this story. There's no actual love between these two characters. Jung Bom thinks he loves song woh because Song Will rescued him from being assaulted, something that no one else has ever done, not even his grandmother, who seemingly cared for him, but looked the other way when her son bombs uncle would beat and rape him and song Wo does not love Jung Bom."
"James Somerton","00:39:24:05","00:39:44:15","He uses him for sexual pleasure and his own emotional support. But that's it. But you wouldn't think that by going over the comments online, many, not all, but many of the fans of this series would have you believe that it's a Beauty and the Beast style love story. A tale as old as time that it's about two lost souls finding each other and helping each other become a whole people."
"James Somerton","00:39:44:23","00:40:07:04","If I've not yet made myself clear, that is not what this is about. So why do they think that? Well, you mom isn't immediately killed by song. Well, unlike his other victims. Therefore, this must mean that he's special. This must mean that song. Well, cares for him whether or not he's good at showing it. Bombs should certainly stand out."
"James Somerton","00:40:07:04","00:40:30:20","Among song was victims. But that's because he's a man sung Woe is a misogynistic sexual sadist, getting joy from torturing and murdering women. And because he is psychologically damaged, he essentially kills his mother over and over and over and over again by murdering women and then goes home to his mother in the form of Eun Bom, who he then assaults mentally and physically, just like his own father did to his own mother."
"James Somerton","00:40:31:10","00:40:57:20","Sometimes he has moments of clarity where he realizes what he's doing, but they don't last long. Sometimes he'll even beg Eun Bom to not leave him breaking down into tears. But this is simply emotional manipulation. He's using bombs, abandonment issues to manipulate him into staying. We know this because when bomb drops the knife during the final altercation, song Lo tells him he doesn't need him anymore, lashing out at him and calling him down to the lowest."
"James Somerton","00:40:58:13","00:41:19:03","So what about Young Bomb? He grew up being neglected by everyone except his sexually abusive uncle who would tell him that he was gross, disgusting, especially after raping him. He was socially awkward, making it near impossible for him to make friends. When people would start to get close to him, they'd be put off by how shy and awkward he was."
"James Somerton","00:41:19:07","00:41:40:18","So in sung Whoa, hugs him, kisses him, says he loves him, says he'll be together forever. Even after crippling him, choking him, hanging him and cutting his throat just just deep enough so that he won't bleed out. Uniform looks past the trauma and abuse and just sees the affection because it's the only affection he's ever gotten from anyone."
"James Somerton","00:41:41:10","00:42:05:23","So he latches onto it even after he knows that song well is dead, he can't let go. And despite the fact that song Lo never shows any unconditional kindness, the bomb even insulting him when doing something that could be characterized as kind. Some readers still look for love story. They've taken an incredibly horrifying and twisted story of trauma and abuse and twisted it further so that they can ship it."
"James Somerton","00:42:06:08","00:42:27:11","They don't see it as a horror story and hope for Bomb to escape his monstrous captor. They hope for Sonko to declare his undying love. They don't want Sonko to get arrested for being a serial killer. They want the pair to ride off into the sunset. This isn't to sad, broken people who have found each other and made each other whole."
"James Somerton","00:42:28:09","00:43:00:04","This is a twisted psycho path, manipulating a poor, lonely boy into being his puppet. This is a story that warns us about the effects of long term abuse on two very different people. How sometimes life long trauma is inescapable without a support system. Killing, stalking, in my opinion, is an amazing psychological horror story, one that kept me swiping through those pages, unable to put it down, hoping that Unbound would escape, that someone would be caught, that young man would be rescued, and given the help that he needs."
"James Somerton","00:43:00:19","00:43:37:22","And yet there are masses of fans out there who want them to get back together in the end, who flame the author online when she ended the series with Songo dead. The monster dies. In the end. He doesn't transform into a handsome prince because he always was one. But not all that glitters is gold. The fact that Songo looks like the man of your dreams is meant to show you that even the person you think is perfect could a monster underneath to watch out for yourself, to not let yourself get trapped into this kind of traumatic relationship?"
"James Somerton","00:43:38:08","00:44:20:16","The author has said in no uncertain terms that she did not intend this to be read as romantic despite her Twitter feed. So why in seven hells are are people, especially teenage girls, reading this as a romance? Well, because they've been raised to know Beauty and the Beast is not about Stockholm syndrome. It's about a woman who is forced into a castle and has to work at making the monsters she shares it with into a respectable human being for her own sake."
"James Somerton","00:44:20:22","00:44:46:03","The original French folktale functioned as a way to ease young women into accepting marriage arrangements, especially those in upper classes where their husbands were usually the shining exemplars of wealthy male privilege. To the women betrothed, this seemed to be like an awful proposition and to ease them into it, there needed to be some kind of device that told them that it gets better, you know, so they wouldn't kill themselves even if it was an errant lie."
"James Somerton","00:44:46:10","00:45:07:19","That sounds familiar. So it's not like the idea that a woman can change a man is new. Culture has been placing the onus on women to be the active force in taking control of men's behavior. For all the Christianized European history, if not longer, and it's from this beauty and the beast attitude that we get the idea that all a woman needs to change her monstrous romantic partner is a little elbow grease."
"James Somerton","00:45:07:19","00:45:33:07","And so end up here with killing stalking, which is neither an arranged marriage nor a heterosexual coupling very 21st century, at which point we are at this weird junction where we're kind of pulled between seven different thought processes about cultural attitudes towards representation, romance, gay men, femininity, femininity, and men. Her criticism of attitudes around common sense is that social marketing and isolation, mental."
"James Somerton","00:45:39:22","00:46:05:10","Nobody should need to do this. Nobody. Nobody should need to look at killing, stalking and say, Well, we need to know if the borderline personality diagnosis was an accurate one to say with confidence whether the author meant for this to be read as erotic or not. No. Someone kills people who literally kills people and not in a Dark Avenger Punisher kind of way."
"James Somerton","00:46:05:14","00:46:28:23","He takes joy in murdering people for fun, full stop and you bomb. He's not in love with Sangamo. He just can't tell the difference between love and abuse. If you read this and your first instinct is to put these two fucked up people together for life, there is a problem. There is a problem with you. There's a problem with our culture."
"James Somerton","00:46:29:04","00:46:55:19","I know from reading the comments of Killing Stalking, Tick Tock compilations are almost as unsettling as the source material that a lot of the reader base are. Young women like middle school. They talk, reading it in class, hiding it from their teachers. Even if you have experimented with dating. You have such a narrow concept of what it means to actually be in a relationship at that age."
"James Somerton","00:46:55:23","00:47:26:09","You have no idea what functional relationship even means. Then, trust me, a lot of older people don't know either. This is not just an abusive relationship. This is an abusive relationship. Engaging in a carnival of over-the-top violence, gaslighting, manipulation, and rape. I am so unsettled thinking about how our society is presenting a young generation with such a twisted idea of romance to the point where there is a shipping community built around these two fuckers."
"James Somerton","00:47:27:12","00:47:51:02","Because this isn't just killing, stalking. This didn't come out of nowhere. It wasn't straight from Beauty and the Beast. This the pro romance, killing, stalking fandom is just the next logical step in the evolution of romanticizing abuse. Especially when you've got Twilight, where Edward and Bella's relationship ticks off every single qualification of an abusive relationship as qualified by social workers."
"James Somerton","00:47:51:10","00:48:11:10","And still, there is this pining over the protagonists like this is a they're going to make it after all, love story about making things work. Even if your parents and society don't like it. And don't even get me started on 50 Shades of Gray. It was hyped up as this racy, sexy, over-the-top, intense sexual romp through BDSM. And then I read it."
"James Somerton","00:48:11:10","00:48:34:17","Not knowing what the hell the hype was about because I've read and Rices Sleeping Beauty series in junior high, maybe a little too young, but I was mature for my age. So in 50 Shades, Women kind of swoon over Christian Gray, even though he's obsessively controlling Anastasia. He violates safe words, metal's interpersonal life, and oversteps boundaries regularly. And the fans are all like, Oh, invade my privacy harder, Daddy."
"James Somerton","00:48:34:21","00:49:01:11","Then you get things like Phantom of the Opera, which, you know, a lot of people read into. The fact that the Phantom named Erik is literally a psycho who murders people and tries to lock up his love interest. Christine, in a basement. But in spite of this, you still get fans who drone on about how Christine was so dumb not to choose Erik because Erik was just so rawly sexual and over powering."
"James Somerton","00:49:01:12","00:49:30:13","Oh, he really does care underneath it all. He threatened to kill her. Oh, but maybe he's good. I read killing Stalking as an honest interpretation of these tropes, which is a hell of a thing to do. Subverting toxic literary tropes by confronting them with the reality of how they function in real life. The only difference is that the author doesn't try to force a romance into the text, even if a huge portion of her fans think that she ruined the ending by probably killing off the serial killer."
"James Somerton","00:49:30:13","00:49:54:22","Which is why they fill her Twitter timeline with fanart of their preferred ending of these two characters Christmases, family reunions, vacations. Samuel, a serial killer who killed women to reenact killing his mother over and over and over again, finally getting in touch with his feelings, realizing that he was gay all along and taking it upon himself to cater to Unabomber's emotional needs because, no, he's not gay."
"James Somerton","00:49:55:00","00:50:26:03","It is stated in the text and the author has stated he is not gay. He is a straight man who is using bomb as a device for to fulfill his needs. And then the months that Young spent locked in song was chosen basement with broken ankles. It's just a story to tell their adopted kids. I you know Christian Gray learns to share the power dynamic and even sub for Anastasia in the end and Bella eventually gains the ability to protect herself and thus does not require Edward to be so obsessive."
"James Somerton","00:50:26:03","00:50:49:04","Belle's beast turns into a man who made a whole generation of people realize they preferred fairies. Erik The Phantom finally does learn to empathize with someone else's needs and lets Christine go. Kind of. Not really. There's a sequel called Love Never Dies. Don't watch it. At which point it occurs to me that it wasn't the romance in the story that the fans fetishize, but the possibility of some world changing and becoming romantic."
"James Somerton","00:50:49:04","00:51:11:00","It's this yearning obsession for redemption arc that the fans want. It's not even that the fandom is choosing to overlook the abuse and the violence and the murder. The fandom embraces all of this. It's just a part of the bumpy road on the way to love. This is someone whose journey this song was redemption. This is song of story, even though it's not."
"James Somerton","00:51:11:21","00:51:35:13","The story is explicitly framed from Unicom's point of view, and it's his emotions and struggles that drive the plot somewhat. At best is an obstruction. But should it be that surprising that audiences are drawn to a character who is depicted to be attractive? And nearly every review of the book calls to attention just how hot he is? I mean, doesn't everyone want to be with someone who's hot?"
"James Somerton","00:51:35:18","00:52:01:19","What's a little character flaw like psychopathy and murder when you're sexy? All of the fandom is focused less around young bombs experience and more about how someone looks, which a crowd of girls fawning over attractive serial killers pleading for his innocence isn't new. I find it weird that this audience is simultaneously dismissive of Moonbeam as a character while at the same time fits into the category of girls who fetishize gay relationships."
"James Somerton","00:52:03:00","00:52:28:19","What's the thought process here? Are a bunch of women looking at a submissive gay man as a cipher their entryway into this relationship? Or have they just kind of moved past the sadness, Brokeback Mountain and the yearning of love? SIMON And they need something a bit more spicy for their gays now."
"James Somerton","00:52:34:14","00:53:00:04","All of this makes me wonder why did it need to be gay in the first place? Was there anything set in this comic that couldn't have been conveyed if Unbound was a woman or even if someone was a woman? Were the sex scenes actually necessary? Did they fulfill a pivotal use in driving the plot? Character? Yes. But were so many of them necessary?"
"James Somerton","00:53:00:21","00:53:25:14","Maybe if Unbound was a woman, the author would have been more sparing in their use of physical abuse. Maybe it would have hit too close to home. But by making Bomber Man, it allows a layer of disconnect and all of the major plot beats worth talking about don't seem to include any elements of sex whatsoever. And it's these sexual moments that the fans latch on to and say, yes, the romance is real."
"James Somerton","00:53:25:22","00:53:56:07","World just needs a chance to open up, which even though the author won literary awards in the category of horror thriller, it did go on to be category ized as a romance. Do people pick it up expecting a romance and read into it? Or would they have seen that from the very beginning? Textually, it does draw a thin line between teasing young Bomb with the romance and teasing the audience, the latter of which is not okay."
"James Somerton","00:53:56:19","00:54:16:11","And I'm not trying to say whether they should or should not have been made because all art has a place. There is a context for every piece of art that can add value to our world, both for enriching our culture, conveying a message about the world we live in, or even acting as a confrontation between what we believe about our culture and what the reality of that culture is."
"James Somerton","00:54:17:04","00:54:41:14","Killing stalking has a lot of interesting, nuanced, layered and poignant things to say that make it work as a horror story and stories like it are actually often enjoyed by people who have suffered abuse. A way for them to see that they're not alone in their trauma. Survivors of abuse can often feel very isolated, so seeing someone who has been hurt like them in fiction can be very cathartic."
"James Somerton","00:54:42:20","00:55:06:20","But all of these things are being overshadowed by how a fetishistic, appropriated audience has turned it into a romance novel. And this is concerning to me, not just about how these people read the media they consume, but also if they might think that this type of relationship is normal. Do they have the ability to understand it when they are in an abusive relationship?"
"James Somerton","00:55:07:06","00:55:38:22","Are they going to do the right things and confront their friends when they're in an abusive relationship? Or are they going to push through and encourage others to do so in the hope that something beautiful will blossom out of the trauma? Or are they completely aware of what is safe and acceptable for them? But their ideas are different for queer people as we in real life progress more and more towards sexual tolerance and acceptance of safe sexual practices in kink, S&M and role play."
"James Somerton","00:55:39:12","00:56:11:08","Are we challenging fiction to raise the bar as we have fewer real applications of forbidden love? Are we, as a culture raised on folklore about enduring abuse for romance, increasing the amount of abuse that must be sustained to achieve true love? We need to be more open to discussing abuse. So listening to those who have been abused so that they might feel comfortable telling their stories so that people can better judge what is healthy and what is not, what is safe and what is dangerous."
"James Somerton","00:56:12:13","00:56:35:02","We need to make safe for the victims of abuse to feel safe. Otherwise, people and not just young people will continue to think that the relationship between someone in uniform is true love. That enduring trauma is fine for the right person, that it's a necessary part of falling in love. Abuse is never a necessary part of falling in love."
"James Somerton","00:56:36:01","00:57:10:08","And so in the description of this video, I've listed resources and links for anyone who might feel that they've become trapped in an abusive relationship. Abuse is not love. Trauma is not romance. Please do not let. They can change. Trap you in an unhealthy or dangerous situation. Get away while you can. Because a happily ever after should never involve pain."

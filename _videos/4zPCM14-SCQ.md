<u>[Fade in on a projector fading in, pointed just past the camera.]</u> 

You're sitting in a packed theater. The lights go down, and you can hear a whisper of anticipation ripple through the crowd, but then it goes silent. Before the movie even begins, you're already on edge.

<u>[Cut to black, then fade in on bed in a dark bedroom. A copy of the book It rests on a shelf.]</u>

You're curled up on your couch. It's late at night, the lights are off, and you're about to watch the latest episode of a TV show that gives you nightmares.

<u>[Fade to black.]</u> 

These three situations all end with a smile as you laugh at yourself for being afraid.

<u>[Clips from various horror movies.]</u>

We love being afraid. Horror movies, books, and TV shows give us a thrill that's hardwired into us as human beings, the thrill of being afraid, having your pulse race, muscles tense, but knowing in the end that you're safe.

I fell in love with horror movies when I was six years old. That's when I saw *Friday the 13th: Part 7: A New Blood* for the very first time. It was my first slasher movie and my first horror movie in general, and besides being kind of shocked to see blood on the screen for the first time, I wasn't the least bit scared. (Granted, *Friday the 13th Part 7* is more akin to an *X-Men* movie than *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*. The main character literally kills Jason by using psychic powers.) But it was still a horror movie and a great gateway to the genre.

For the next two decades, I devoured that genre. I had a shelf dedicated to my horror movie VHSs, DVDs, and now Blu-Rays. *Halloween*, *Friday the 13th*, *Nightmare on Elm Street*, *Hellraiser*, *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, all the greats. I eventually moved on to the grandparents of the horror genre, the Universal Monsters: Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy, and the Invisible Man. And in my midteens, after letting *everyone know that I was gay* and getting to know more people in the queer community, I came to a realization:

Gays really love horror movies.

<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Of course, there are exceptions (I still can't get my roommate to watch 2017’s *It*), but for the most part, it seemed like every gay guy and girl absolutely adored horror movies, from the top-tier ones like *The Exorcist*, to the bottom-of-the-rung direct-to-video sequels, to *The Leprechaun*, *Child's Play*, and *Sleepaway Camp*. There's even a massive amount of gay-themed slasher movies on Netflix &mdash; usually involving frat brothers. 

So, where did this gay fascination with horror come from? <mark v>James Jenkins of Valancourt Books notes that the connection between gay fiction and horror goes</mark> all the way <mark v>back to the gothic novels of the</mark> <mark v>early 1800s</mark>. <mark v>Many gothic authors, like Matthew Lewis, William Thomas Beckford, and Francis Latham, were gay,</mark> and that reflected in their work. <mark v>According to Jenkins</mark>:

In 1890, Lippincott's Monthly Magazine commissioned a short story by <mark fc=false>then-little-known author Oscar Wilde</mark> that would eventually become the novel *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. 

The story follows the titular Dorian Gray, who has had a portrait painted by an artist named Basil. Once he's seen the portrait, he wishes that it would grow old and age instead of him. And his wish having been granted, the portrait becomes a twisted reflection of Dorian's deviance and vices. The wish for eternal youth is certainly present in gay culture, but the dandyism of The Picture of Dorian Gray is much more obvious in other parts of the work. For instance, <mark>when Basil has his first meeting with Dorian Gray:</mark>

<u>[Direct quotes of the novel appear on-screen. James reads these out in a low-pass filtered voice.]</u> 
> <mark>When our eyes met, I felt I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.</mark>

And then later, saying:

> <mark></mark>We were quite close...
>
> Almost touching.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=sf1 %}>

This is false. According to [Wilde’s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde), by 1890, Wilde had published a poetry collection, gone on a speaking tour of the US, written a play, and edited a monthly magazine. He’d also written multiple short stories.

<h2>BASIL/DORIAN</h2>

The novel starts out in Basil's home where he and Lord Henry are spending a day together. In the middle of the room stands the portrait of Dorian, which leads to the two men talking about him. We learn that he is very important to Basil and the way in which he speaks about him is very personal and has a homoerotic undertone. <mark>Basil tells Lord Henry of the first meeting with Dorian:</mark>

> <mark>When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself</mark> [...] Something seemed to tell me I was in the verge of a terrible crisis in my life [...] I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room. (13)

Artists are often referred to as eccentric and passionate, which can make this very astonishing reaction of his to be only fascination for an artistic object as it was said before. But these are very strong feelings of one man towards another. This fact can never be disregarded or diminished and sets the tone for homoeroticism. Basil's physical reaction can very well be seen as physical attraction and the fear he shows can be the fear that is associated with coming out, the fear of going against the norm and someone finding out. 

As we learn more about Basil and Dorian's first meeting the homoerotic theme becomes more tangible. Basil says <mark>“we were quite close, almost touching</mark>. Our eyes met again” (14). This is a great indication that shows a meeting beyond aesthetics only. It shows an emotional, possibly even erotic, emotional connection between the men. In many ways this interaction can be seen as flirtatious and certainly not a manner in which men were supposed to relate to each other. It shows the men sharing looks and glances, noticing the physical closeness and feeling something for one another. Dorian seems to share this feeling. Basil says: “[Dorian], too, felt that we were destined to know each other” (14). Since Dorian feels the same way we can assume that what is shared between them is not a matter of an artist and his subject, but a man and another man. We also learn that Basil flatters Dorian and finds “strange pleasure in saying things that [he] know[s] [he] shall be sorry for having said” (19). If we now consider the fact that Basil flatters Dorian constantly by giving him compliments, an interpretation of this as courtship is not that farfetched. A heterosexual friendship between two men does not consist of this kind of flirtation and courtship. Basil saying to Dorian something he will regret having said also indicates that he has uttered words he would normally not say to anyone else. Thus, it seems clear that his feelings for Dorian are something new and unfamiliar to him. Presumptions that this is some sort of sexual identity being awakened are easily made. 

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Later in the novel, Lord Henry, a dear friend of the artist Basil, says to Dorian:

> <mark></mark>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheeks with shame.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p14" %}>

Shame has a very central role in the novel as well, being closely connected to secrecy. Rasmussen says that the “relationship between inclusivity and coming out, [is] a relationship that often situates the closet as a zone of shame and exclusion” (144). Lord Henry, when issuing his powerful influence over Dorian, notices the distress the young man undergoes and he also says,

> <mark></mark>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, daydreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheeks with shame. (26)

Oscar <mark>Wilde does not present any of the characters</mark> in *The Picture of Dorian Gray* as *overtly* <mark>homosexual</mark>. <mark>In fact, Lord Henry is married, and Dorian begins dating an actress</mark>, but he's more in love with the art of her acting. In fact, when she tells him that she'll stop acting to be with him, he dumps her, and he's not the slightest bit upset to hear about her suicide. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p16" %}>
<h2>EFFEMINACY</h2>

*The Picture of Dorian Gray* comes across as a very effeminate novel, both in its presentation and in the way the characters are described. The novel is in fact presented in a rather 'straight' fashion when the homoerotic theme is downplayed when not explicitly stated. But effeminacy comes across not only in the way the characters are presented, but in the language Wilde uses to show a rather “feminine” world. <mark>Wilde does not present any of the characters</mark> as <mark>homosexual</mark>. <mark>In fact, Lord Henry is married and Dorian falls in love with an actress</mark>, but both these relationships are very superficial. It is a very straight language in that sense, but on a closer look we see it is not the case. By writing in the manner that he does, Wilde himself shows an effeminate streak as it will be shown further down. 

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In 2005, Joseph Carroll, professor of philosophy and literature at the University of Missouri, wrote, 

> <mark></mark>Among heterosexuals, feminine characteristics act as a stimulus or trigger for male sexual desire. One chief reason effeminacy can be easily integrated with a homoerotic persona is that effeminacy indirectly suggests that the effeminate male could himself be an object of male desire.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p17" %}>

Feminine behaviour by men has more or less always been looked down upon, even during Wilde's time. Standfort points out that “feminine characteristics are less valued than masculine ones, in general, but especially in men” and that “transgressions into femininity by men are more negatively valued than transgressions into masculinity by women” (599). Schaffer believes that male aesthetes to “justify this behaviour, they had to create a visual style which metonymically associated themselves with women while distinctly affirming their superiority” (42). This means that during those days it was more acceptable to take on this feminine and aesthetic lifestyle for men like Wilde, who is believed to have been a dandy. Carroll states,

> <mark></mark>Among heterosexuals, feminine characteristics act as a stimulus or trigger for male sexual desire. One chief reason effeminacy can be easily integrated with a homoerotic persona is that effeminacy indirectly suggests that the effeminate male could himself be an object of male desire. (296)

Early in the story, before the more supernatural elements kick in, Dorian is upset that the portrait will forever remain beautiful and young, while he will wither and age. 

> <mark num=1>The tears welled in his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he were praying.</mark>

<mark num=2>Joseph Carroll finds scenes of women lying prone and weeping are common enough in Victorian fiction, but scenes depicting males in that posture are vanishingly rare.</mark> 

<mark num=3>Once the novel saw its final publication</mark>, at least for the 1800s, <mark num=4>critics zeroed in on the effeminacy of the novel, especially the main character.</mark> Over the next century, critics and fans would discover the more overt homosexuality in Oscar Wilde's most famous work.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.homo_codes at="p18" %}>

<mark num=3>Following the release of the novel</mark> <mark num=4>the reviews that criticised it paid attention to the effeminacy of Dorian Gray.</mark> In the novel when Dorian is displeased he “made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather taken a fancy” (24). One reviewer calls the characters puppies, noting Dorian's behaviour in the previous quote to be improper for a boy of twenty years (Mason, 18). 

Carroll, likewise, views Dorian's behaviour to be more fit for a woman than for a man, no matter his age. In the novel Dorian is upset that the painting will forever remain beautiful while his beauty and youth will wither: <mark num=1>“The tears welled in his eyes; he tore his hand away, and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.</mark> (35). <mark num=2>Carroll finds “[s]cenes of women lying prone and weeping are common enough in Victorian fiction; scenes depicting males in that posture are vanishingly rare”</mark> (297).

Now, instead of pulling quotes from novels and intellectual articles for the rest of the video, I'm going to start focusing on more modern interpretations of gay horror. And I'd like to talk about the world’s the most famous monster... that you never knew was analogously queer.

Frankenstein: "IT'S ALIVE!!" *Grabbed by two people* "In the name of god! Now I know what it feels like to be God!"

<james {% include timecode %}>

Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein: Or, the Modern Prometheus*. Victor Frankenstein, the titular mad scientist, shows little to no interest in his  wife-to-be and is determined to create life on his own: his own perfect man. (Something explored without subtlety in *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*.) But when digging up the body parts that he'll eventually use to compile the monster, he makes sure to pick the... *sexiest* body parts he can find. He wants an Adonis, just like Frank-N-Furter. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Once born against his own free will, as we all are, Frankenstein's monster is rejected by its creator as something terrible, a regretful mistake that ought to be done away with. He even flees from the monster because it's so hideous. Frankenstein's reaction to the birth of his creation isn't that far off from the reaction of many overly religious parents when they find out that their child is gay. They look at them as monsters: ungodly. And although most of these parents don't actually attempt to *kill* their children (though that does happen) they may cut them out of their lives; an emotional murder, if you will. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But at the same time, there is a homoerotic subtext between Victor Frankenstein and his monster. The monster tracks down his creator, and Victor discovers that the monster is intelligent, well-read, and curious. He is, ostensibly, everything a man like Victor would want a lover. There's a direct connection between them. Victor's repulsion toward the monster could read as the Victorian equivalent of “no fats, no fems”. 

Every time Frankenstein's creature (sometimes referred to as Adam) is seen by the local population, he's met with horror. He hasn't done anything to them, but they look at him as a monster anyway. And rejection drives him to become the monster they see him as. Eventually, Adam begs Victor to create for him a mate. He just wants someone like him, someone who knows his struggles, someone to share his life with. He, like any other person, deserves as much. (Sound familiar?) 

Though Victor initially agrees, he eventually destroys the potential bride. Adam the monster is not allowed to have a mate, not allowed to have someone to love and be loved by, because he's a monster. He's not like normal people. He doesn't deserve to have what everyone else does. Because... he is different. And so, you see the parallels between Frankenstein's monster... and being gay.

Now, this all changed a little bit with the film adaptation. James Whales, himself a gay director, helmed 1931’s Frankenstein and its 1935 sequel, The Bride of Frankenstein. <mark x>Whales, oddly, made sure to remove the more overt homoerotic subtext between Victor and his monster by adding the character of Fritz for Victor to speak with and by making the monster mute, and also making Victor much more socially active.</mark> Off-topic, but Fritz is the character we've all come to known as Igor, for some reason. Also, Victor is inexplicably renamed Henry in the movie, but I'm gonna stick to calling him Victor for the sake of consistency. <mark>Victor is also much more socially active in the movies</mark>, as I said, <mark>adding a further layer of separation between him and the monster.</mark> 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.gothic_studies at="p188" %}>

In both *Frankenstein* and *The Bride of Frankenstein*, Whale emphasises Victor's heterosexuality by replacing Victor's solitary relationship with the Creature by a more social and public one. <mark x>The possibility of any social interaction between Victor and the Creature that might result in a homosocial / homosexual subtext is basically removed by Whale since, whereas Shelley's Creature is highly intelligent and intellectually attractive for Victor, Whale's monster cannot speak in the 1931 film, and can barely articulate a few words in the 1935 sequel.</mark> Whale's 1935 film also offers the Creature a female companion, if on! y for a limited time, wh en in the novel Victor destroys the fen1a1e creature he is working on, thus eliminating any potential heterosexual competition for the Creature's attention. In both films, Whale also chooses to have Victor proceed with his experiments with the help of either Fritz or Dr Pretorius, and other characters actually witness his work. <mark x>This socially active Victor</mark> <mark x>prevents consequently any reading of his personal motive in his making of the creature and the possible relationship that would ensue.</mark> Whale still hints at Victor's possible homosexuality in his relationship to Fritz, and most specifically in ali his scenes with Dr Pretorius, a character culturally encoded as 'deviant', i.e. homosexual, who thus underscores Whale's subtle, ironic retelling of Shelley's story - he replaces Victor's homosexual interest in the Creature with another man.

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<mark x>Victor's relationship with his wife-to-be, Elizabeth, is also much more prominent in the films. She's an active part of his life, even being there for the birth of the monster.</mark> 

<mark v>Indeed, the films never seem to question Victor's sexuality but, on the contrary, repeatedly emphasized his heterosexuality, whereas the novel leaves this aspect of Victor's character more open to discussion. The novel’s Victor is obsessed with the creature who repeatedly makes his pulse beat faster and his brows sweat.</mark>

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.gothic_studies at="p188" %}>

The character of Elizabeth in both Whale's films and Branagh's 1994 film reinforces further Victor's heterosexuality. <mark x>Each film implicates Elizabeth in Victor's experience, and thus removes the option of a homosexual reading of the creation scene. Whale modifies this scene in both films to incorporate an audience, one which includes Elizabeth.</mark> In fact, in Whale's *Frankenstein*, Victor at first refuses to permit Dr Waldman and his friend Victor Moritz to disturb his experiment, and he specifically instructs Fritz not to allow anyone in. However, when Elizabeth asks him to open the door, he yields and actually shows loving concern for her. The tone that Frankenstein uses to talk to Moritz also differs significantly from the one he uses with Elizabeth, another instance of his heterosexual attachment to her. As for Branagh, although he does not include Elizabeth in his creation scene, he adds an extra scene beforehand. Fearing that Victor might be involved with another woman, Elizabeth decides to go to Geneva to ask him to come home with her. Although Victor stays to pursue his experiment, the preceding scene is reinforces Victor's commitment to Elizabeth. To a large extent, bath directors seem to offer readings of the novel that emphasize the characters' heterosexuality without including Shelley's critique of her male characters, and her deliberate openness regarding questions of sexuality.

<mark v>Indeed, the films never seem to question Victor's sexuality but on the contrary repeatedly emphasize his heterosexuality whereas the novel leaves this aspect of Victor's character more open to discussion. The novel's Victor is obsessed with the Creature, who repeatedly makes his pulse beat faster and his brow sweat.</mark> For instance, Victor declares: '1 remembered also the nervous fever with which 1 had been seized just at the ti me that 1 dated my creation' ( 49). Victor also reacts nervously when his father comments:

Skal expounds upon this component of the Frankenstein films. <mark>“There is an overriding fantasy of male-male procreation,”</mark> Skal says.

The original cut of *Bride of Frankenstein* was actually 15 minutes longer than the one we have now, which sits at just over an hour long. That's because the ending was drastically edited and changed. The reason for this was that it conflicted with the Hayes production code, the era's version of the MPAA. What went against the code? Well, it was originally made obvious that the heart of the monster’s bride was taken from Frankenstein's wife, Elizabeth. This would imply that Frankenstein and Pretorius’ mutual goal was predicated on the destruction of Frankenstein's heterosexual relationship, that he literally sacrificed Elizabeth for the realization of his other ambitions. Effectively, he would have chosen a homosexual partnership over marriage, and since gay anything was a big no-no for the Hays Code, that had to be cut down. Instead, Elizabeth is actually present for the ending and escapes the destruction of the lab, along with Dr. Frankenstein, while the monster’s would-be bride and the overtly queer-coded Dr. Pretorius are left to perish. Gotta let that breeding pair escape, right?

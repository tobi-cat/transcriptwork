I know the majority of you were around last year when these accusations were first brought up; I have spoken to many of you privately and in live streams to explain the situation in detail. I am shocked to see that I was worth seemingly two hours of a four-hour video — especially when all of these issues have been discussed before one year ago today. Especially since there was nothing new brought up in this video.</p><p>If you have any concerns about these issues, please message me and I will answer all of your questions in detail. </p><p>Again, I am so grateful for your support.

	  "content": "<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>So there's a total clusterfuck going on with the next video. It's sponsored by a sex toy brand that requires us to show the toy in the video, but because said toy is shown, YouTube is rating the video to 18+. Problem #2 is that the brand will only pay us if the video hits 200k views within a month, which is kind of impossible when a video is 18+. So I'm currently in a nightmarish back and forth with them, and the agency that helps us get sponsors, about what to do. The sponsor even got mad at me for sharing the initial video with you guys last night before they approved the ad-read, which is the first time a sponsor has EVER gotten mad about that. So yeah. Having a fun day.</p><p>But all that nonsense doesn't mean you guys shouldn't have the early access you pay for! So I cut the sponsorship out of the video (except for the shout out at the beginning, which I forgot to edit out, but these things take hours to render so fuck it lol) so that you guys can watch it while they twiddle their thumbs about what they're going to do. They basically have two choices. Guarantee the payout without requiring the 200k views, or cancel the sponsorship (and then I can just replace them with SquareSpace). So we'll see what happens.</p><p>ANYWAY! I hope you enjoy the video XD</p>",

It's gotten so bad in the bathroom that the ceilings actually starting to fall apart. </p><p>And now it's leaking in the room where I have my editing computer so I moved the computer to the kitchen table. I'm looking into if I can break my lease because the landlord isn't exactly being prompt with repairs, and where leaks are mold is sure to follow. </p><p>Hopefully I can have the video shot and edited this week.

Nothing too serious! He's not dying or anything but it's enough that I'd like to give him some time before jumping back into production. So unfortunately we won't be able to have the video out at the time we promised. We're both really really sorry for the delay, and hope we haven't let you down too much. We're still aiming for very early August so fingers crosse. </p><p>I hope you're all having a good summer and I promise there's lots to come very soon. :-)</p>",

	  "content": "<p>Hi there everyone,</p><p><br>I hope you all had a great weekend. Mine was, well, not great. As anyone who follows me on Twitter will probably know. </p><p><br>The Reader's Digest version is: I criticized Nebula on Twitter, in an admittedly clumsy way, and multiple creators who are on Nebula took offence and vehemently defended the company. There were no horrible arguments between any of us and, as of last night, things seemed to be on their way to being cleared up (even though some pretty major YouTubers popped up falsely accusing me of plagiarism. I'll go into some detail regarding that below this message if you're interested). I did set my Twitter account to private though, since I was getting some harassment.</p><p><br>Then early today I checked my work e-mail, which is public in my Twitter bio, and found 44 e-mails from fans of the other creators involved accusing me of trying to destroy the livelihood of marginalized creators (for criticizing Nebula), insulting me in any number of ways, and even threatening me. Some of the typical death threats anyone on social media has had to get used to, but some very specific threats as well. Some threatened to badmouth Nick and I to potential sponsors, and one person, who identified herself as a woman, threatened to accuse me of sexual harassment on social media. Even though I have no idea who she is and... I'm gay. So she obviously doesn't know anything about me other than someone they follow had a disagreement with me.</p><p><br>So I've taken some steps to TRY to get this under control. I've spoken with authorities, who are going to look into the matter. They've asked that I not speak with any of the creators involved until they do an investigation into whether it was targeted. I don't think ANY of the creators actively sent their fans after me, to be clear. I really, really don't. That's just the process with the police. And I've also disabled any invite links to the Patreon Discord for the time being. I can still personally send invites, but any links listed here are dead for now. </p><p><br>If you have any questions about any of this, PLEASE feel free to ask. Oh, and there's a podcast coming out in the morning that was recorded before any of this, so Nick and I were in MUCH better spirits lol.</p><p><br></p><p>The Plagiarism accusations:</p><p><br>1. One of my earliest videos (Queer Baiting in TV, Aug 2020) originally had a section covering the TV show Merlin, in which there was a highlight real of queer moments from the show that I took from a much larger highlight reel video on YouTube. It turned out that clip was actually from a video from the channel Are They Gay? and they brought it to my attention. I immediately removed the whole Merlin section from the video and reposted it.</p><p><br>2. The FIRST section of the Queer Baiting series is directly based on the book \"The Celluloid Closet\" by Vito Russo, and the documentary of the same name based on the book. Before publishing the video I requested and received the right to do this by the copyright holders, which is outlined in the description of the video.</p><p><br>3. My original Disney video, \"Evil Queens: A Gay Look At Disney History\" (September 2020) is directly based on the book \"Tinker Belles and Evil Queens\" by Sean P. Griffin. Before making the video I received permission from the author but, as I was very new to this, didn't properly credit him. I deleted the original video within a week of release and re-upoloaded it with Sean's name listed directly in the main title sequence. </p><p><br>Since then I've had opening titles for almost all of my videos, which I use for thanking patrons, as well as giving proper credits to anyone whose worked has been used in the production of the video, such as journalists with the \"History of Queer Panic\" video. </p>",

So, as a lot of you know, my YouTube videos haven't been getting the same recommendations or views lately as they used to. Started around January when a lot of my videos, old ones and new ones, started getting hit with the dreaded 18+.</p><p>I've been informed by someone who actually has a manager who works with YouTube that when you have multiple 18+ videos on your channel, the algorithm stops recommending your channel to people under 18, and even stops recommending them to people over 18 who don't usually watch 18+ content. But it can possibly be fixed by deleting your 18+ stuff (unlisted and private isn't good enough). So I'm going to do that tonight.</p><p>Some of my videos that have been hit are so random, like Part 2 of the Camp video series (even though the full series as one video is perfectly fine), and yet my video about the history of gay porn (which talks about porn, underage porn, and murder) is also perfectly fine. </p><p>Anyway!</p><p>I don't want you guys going without access to the videos. They wouldn't exist without you. Hell, my channel as a whole wouldn't exist without you! So I've put them up on Vimeo and you can find the links below. Hopefully this will clear up the mess and my channel will go back to normal with the next video? Hopefully?

They even went ahead and added in the ad breaks for me. Way more than I put in, personally. Their monetization policies continue to confuse the ever loving hell out of me.</p><p>My first impulse was to keep it entirely Patreon exclusive because so many of you signed up specifically for that video and I didn't think it would be fair to share it. But a few of you have urged me to share it in comments as well as DMs. So I want to run a poll to see what everyone thinks.

My mom's been extremely sick for the last year with a very rare form of liver cancer. After seeing multiple specialists, and going through rounds and rounds of hellish treatment with nothing but negative news, she's decided to move forward with medical assistance in dying after Christmas. </p><p>So I won't be publishing a public video on YouTube this month. But I will be posting a patron exclusive video about the history of the queer panic defense in the United States. It will be available for all $10 patrons for the first thirty days, and then available to all patrons after that.</p><p>I'm going to try to have a January video ready before I go home for Christmas to be with my mom so that I'm not completely absent from public YouTube for too long, but since the script isn't finished yet, that's still up in the air.</p><p>Lastly, I want to thank you all SO SO much for supporting me here. I can't even describe how thankful I am for each and every one of you. I'm going to try to do a stream before the holidays but just in case I don't, I hope you all have a really amazing holiday season. If you can, spend time with your loved ones. Give them a hug. Let them know how much you love them. And if your parents are still in your life, hug them extra tight. </p><p>&lt;3 </p>",

Last year was different because of Covid, but this year is apparently worse than ever. I've seen a lot of creators complain about the lack of views and engagement on their new videos, and I've <em>definitely</em> seen this myself.</p><p>I was feeling pretty crappy about it until I learned about the summer slow down. A lot of creators will take a \"break\" over the summer (break = planning and shooting videos for the fall). Since a lot of videos released in the summer will get lower views, and therefore hurt the channel in YouTube's algorithm. I thought this might be a good idea, the summer \"break\", but since you guys are investing in me I thought it only right to get your feedback on it before I actually decide on anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: If I do take a \"break\", September will awash in content. </p>",

	  "content": "<p>Good evening you lovely people,</p><p><br></p><p>Hope your weeks starting off well. Just wanted to post an update to keep everyone in the know. Never really done one of these before so forgive me if I ramble a bit.</p><p>Minor health note: I've been having a hard time breathing lately. I'm asthmatic so that's not super uncommon for me, but this has been pretty persistent. I've concluded that it's anxiety, though, since I seem to breathe fine when I'm distracted. Hurray for broken brains! lol. Probably from stress from the job loss and such.</p><p>Since losing my \"normal\" job, I've entirely refocused all my energies into the channel, putting out two videos this past month. My goal right now, though it might be an unrealistic one, is to release two videos per month, plus a weekly podcast and at least semi-regular streams. I'll drop some links below for the podcast, which should be returning this week.</p><p>My next video, \"Yuri on Ice: How Gay is Gay Enough?\" is just about ready to start shooting. And with how fast I tend to edit these days, I wouldn't be surprised if that's live this weekend. A second video will be going up later this month if all goes as planned. It's something I've been working on for a while, and have had written since last year. It's taken a few different forms, but I think I've figured out an engaging way to present a very... not fun topic. If you're into true crime, this one might be right up your alley. </p><p>For July, I should be releasing a video about Loki and non-binary gender identity representation early in the month, probably to coincide with the 5th episode of the Disney+ show. That timing seemed to work pretty well with WandaVision so let's see if I can make a Marvel double hitter. Later in the month, I should be releasing a video about \"Shameless\" and how conservative politicians use the queer community as a scapegoat to fearmonger amongst the lower-working class. I grew up in the same kind of world as Shameless so its something I know a bit about. </p><p>August is a little up in the air, but in September, I plan to make a video about how Broadway is way more homophobic than you might think. October will have my annual horror movie video: \"Fear Coding: The Love of Queer Monsters\". </p><p>This all relies on my not getting hit by a bus, of course lol. But that's what I've got on my to-do list so far. Plus the charity stream later this month where Nick and I will be marathoning some big lego sets and answering any and all questions to raise money for a queer youth charity. As for the podcast our plan is release an episode a week, but each 4th episode will actually be streamed live on youtube so that you guys can can take part in it is well. Ask questions. Voice opinions. Stuff like that. </p><p>Thanks for reading my ramblings, and I hope everyone is doing great! You guys have definitely made losing my job a lot less stressful, and I hope I can find a way to really thank you for that :) Until then, have an awesome week! And I'll see you on the ice this weekend ;)<br><br><br>James</p><p><br></p><p>Podcast stuff:</p><p>Apple Podcast: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/a-thousand-tiny-tantrums/id1516936011\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/a-thousand-tiny-tantrums/id1516936011</a></p><p>Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0Pykc53lPI25wC9yhlyG4V\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://open.spotify.com/show/0Pykc53lPI25wC9yhlyG4V</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaH4twn9Xpr8q9IHyxds1HQ/videos\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaH4twn9Xpr8q9IHyxds1HQ/videos</a></p>",

First there was an issue with the video encoding, then the recorder started corrupting, then the audio interface messed up, then the teleprompter stopped working, etc etc etc. It's been a nightmare. I'm 90% sure this video is cursed lol. </p><p><br></p><p>Eventually I got it all filmed, only to discover that the audio is absolutely terrible.  And I just don't feel right releasing it like that, especially since I know a lot of people listen to these things more so than watch them. So I'm going to try shooting it again. For the fifth time. But not today. Tomorrow or Tuesday. I need some time to try and fix all the issues. All of this to say I won't have a video out for March. Which I'm really disappointed about. I 100% intended on having this out by the end of the month but then all my equipment became possessed. I WILL have it out soon. Just not quite as soon as I'd hoped. Maybe I can get this and another video out in April. 🤞</p><p>I'm really sorry about this. </p>",
